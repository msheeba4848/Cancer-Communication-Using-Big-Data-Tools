Street_Hedgehog_9595,cath,Catholic,"To win, you need to make it your number one goal to put God first. I might sound harsh, but you need to be actually serious about this. If this were some competition to win 1,000,000 dollars if you didn't have sex again before marriage, do you think you'd do better? If yes, then you have a lot of work to do. And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.

tweetysvoice,,,"For an Aquatic Veterinarian, It’s Never ‘Just a Fish’
The New York Times · by Emily Anthes


Many students begin veterinary school with career aspirations that date back to childhood, when they fell in love with the idea of ministering to cats and dogs, or horses, or the exotic animals at the zoo. Jessie Sanders arrived at veterinary school with a more particular passion. “I was the one weird fish kid,” she said.

It was an interest that had surprised even her. In college, Dr. Sanders had started volunteering at an aquarium, hoping to work with the whales. Instead, she found herself assigned to the fish team — and falling hard for her finned charges.

“I just love fish,” she said. “I love the way they’re built. I love the way they interact with the environment. And there’s still so much that we just don’t know about all the little internal workings.”

Today, Dr. Sanders runs Aquatic Veterinary Services, with patients that include carnival goldfish, pet store bettas and prizewinning koi worth tens of thousands of dollars. Last year, she became one of the first 10 veterinarians to receive a board certification in fish practice, a wholly new accreditation.

Dr. Sanders spoke with The New York Times about life as a fish veterinarian. Her story was based on two conversations, and her responses were edited and condensed.

I’ve done nothing but pet fish for 10 years, and it’s been awesome and challenging. I like the challenge of setting everything in an underwater environment. And the amount of personalities that you get in fish — they have so many little quirks. Some of them are super chill and nice, and some of them are complete terrors.

We had a hospital for about three years. Unfortunately, a 24-hour gym moved in and shared the adjacent wall, and they liked to play their music all night long. Fish have an organ known as a lateral line that picks up on vibrations; it’s how they’re able to sense predators, swim in a school together. Obviously, having rock music played at you all hours in the night is very stressful. Anything connected to that wall we lost within the first month they opened.

We just have a mobile practice now. We serve the greater San Francisco Bay Area. I’ll drive from three to eight hours in a day. When I get there, it’s the same as you taking your cat or your dog to the vet. We’ll have a discussion: What’s been going on? Have they been eating? Is there anything in particular that you want me to take a really close look at?

The most common “disease” that we see in fish is actually poor water chemistry. Like the air that we breathe, the water that a fish swims in is critical to their overall health. If you’re breathing in nothing but pollution, you’re going to be prone to more illnesses. So we check the water chemistry; if it’s terrible, the fish are already stressed out. I don’t want to put hands on them because that could make things worse.

Then you’ve got to catch the fish. I have a bunch of different nets. The cute little square aquarium nets for tank fish — I usually use one on each side of the fish and kind of squish ’em together. In bigger ponds, I use seine nets. They have floats on the top and weights on the bottom. I have ponds that are so big that I have to use two nets and get in there with my waders. It’s one of those things you’ve got to practice. No one’s good when they start out, but I’m really good at it now.

After I catch them, they’ll be transferred to the exam tub. I usually have a tub of their tank or their pond water that is ready to go with some sedatives. For most of my physical exams, I prefer that the fish be lightly anesthetized. It’s less stress for them; trying to restrain a wet, slippery torpedo is not really going to be in either of our favors. We just need them to be handleable. So they might be wiggling a fin at me, but once they’re anesthetized, I can get a really good look all around their body.

Usually we’re going to do skin mucus and gill biopsies. The skin mucus biopsy is mostly just looking for parasites, which can irritate fish and make them lethargic. The gill biopsies are more important because that can show us what their respiratory system is doing. It provides us a great diagnostic tool without having to stick a tube down their throat.

If we need to do any more diagnostics, ultrasound or radiographs, we can do that while the fish is asleep. One client has a pond of goldfish, and there’s one goldfish that just hasn’t been able to get up and swim with everybody; she’s kind of stuck on the bottom. We’re going to take X-rays.

A buoyancy disorder is when a fish that should be able to swim in the middle of the water column is either sinking to the bottom or floating to the surface. It’s very important for fish with buoyancy disorders that we can evaluate their internal anatomy — specifically their swim bladder, a little air sac that helps them float.

It can be diet related, too. This is very common in goldfish ponds, where you have fish that float after eating. If there’s a lot of competition and limited food during feeding time, it’s madness. They’re all just eating, eating, eating; they suck down a little bit too much air.

That can be corrected by spreading out the feeding a little bit more or feeding a sinking diet. A lot of fish diets float because it gives owners the opportunity to evaluate them at the surface, and obviously it’s a lot more interactive. Koi and goldfish are naturally bottom-feeding fish. But we have taught them — because they’re golden retrievers, they’ll do anything for food — to come to the surface during feeding time.

For fish surgeries, there’s many different levels. I do a lot of enucleations, which is eyeball removals. In fish, these are so easy; they don’t have eyelids or need to have any sort of globe in there to look normal. I did one for a little goldfish that actually had an abscess in her eye. The fish was just utterly miserable. We were able to get that out, and the next day the owner is, like, “She’s a completely different fish. She’s eating, she’s zipping around.” They heal up just beautifully every single time.

We see ovarian cancer very commonly in koi. If we catch it early enough, we can do surgery to remove it. We use a higher dose of the sedative. We have a specialized trough that the fish sits upright in. They sit over a little reservoir that has the anesthetized water. There is an aquarium pump that pumps it through a tube up into the fish’s mouth, it goes over their gills, runs down the side of their body and then back to the reservoir.

The biggest challenge is the public not even knowing that fish veterinarians exist. Even within our own profession, we’re ridiculed. Fish aren’t respected as pets in general. Like, “Why are you wasting your time? It’s just a fish.” For a lot of people, it’s not just a fish. It’s an actual living and breathing animal that needs to have care and respect. A lot of fish are taken into homes as practice pets and get the really short end of the stick.",0,1719792462,,,0,lb1zp67,t3_1dsfh2z,t3_1dsfh2z,1719792477,11,False,aquarium,t5_2rf28

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that  the doctors who have no  interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.  With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list  and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.  It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.  The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.  The LDN tablets she was taking  were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.  Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.  My own medical cabinet is quite empty now! 



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and  residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.



I think your questions are excellent and would be appreciated at the LDN RT Webinars.  Whatever questions are not answered during the webinar are answered on the LDNRT You Tube site,

successiseffort,,,"""When Dr. Fauci became head of NIAID, azidothymidine, known as AZT, was the only candidate as an AIDS remedy. AZT is a “DNA chain terminator,” randomly destroying DNA synthesis in reproducing cells. It had been developed in 1964 for cancer, but abandoned as too toxic even for short-term therapy. It was deemed so worthless that it was not even patented. In 1985, Samuel Broder, head of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), claimed having found that AZT killed HIV in test tubes. The British company Burroughs Wellcome then patented it as an AIDS remedy. “Recognizing financial opportunity in the desperate terror of young AIDS patients facing certain death, the drug company set the price at up to $10,000/year per patient—making AZT one of the most expensive drugs in pharmaceutical history. Since Burroughs Wellcome could manufacture AZT for pennies per dose, the company anticipated a bonanza.”


""Wellcome research teams had engaged in widespread data tampering. More than half of the AZT patients suffered adverse reactions so deadly that they needed multiple blood transfusions just to keep them alive. Nevertheless, Fauci kept on lying himself to the top of the world, with little scrutiny from mainstream media.""

According to Dr. Claus Köhnlein, a German oncologist, “We virtually killed a whole generation of AIDS patients without even noticing it because the symptoms of the AZT intoxication were almost indistinguishable from AIDS.”

Dijon2017,,,"I’m sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient’s and cancer’s responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It’s not clear how “the nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit”. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an “aggressive” type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient’s subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient’s cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it’s entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother’s complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

No-Law-4434,,,"from Google Ai

This report dives deep into the analysis of a lymph node biopsy from your right neck using a technique called flow cytometry. Here's a breakdown with more details and a cautious approach to interpreting the results:

The Bad News (Potential):

The presence of an abnormal cell population expressing CD30 is a red flag. CD30 is a protein marker often associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system.
Increased Forward Scatter and Side Scatter suggest the cells are larger and more granular, another characteristic sometimes seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.
The Not-So-Bad News (Uncertainties):

The report emphasizes the need for morphologic correlation. This means looking at the cells under a microscope to confirm their exact shape and size. Flow cytometry can provide clues, but a definitive diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma relies heavily on microscopic examination.
Some markers like CD15 (positive) and CD40 (positive) can be positive in Hodgkin lymphoma, but they're not exclusive. Other types of lymphomas can also express them.
Markers like CD20 (weakly positive) and CD5 (variable) are typically negative in Hodgkin lymphoma, but the results here might be due to technical issues.
Overall:

This report raises a suspicion of Hodgkin lymphoma, but it's not conclusive. It's crucial to have the tissue sample examined by a pathologist under a microscope (morphologic correlation) for a definitive diagnosis.

Here's what likely happens next:

Your doctor will discuss these results with you and likely recommend further testing, including a lymph node biopsy analysis under a microscope.
Depending on the final diagnosis, they'll outline the next steps, which could involve additional tests, scans, or treatment options.

Titania_F,,,"Well in the last 4 years I have nearly died, 3 times in the last 7 months, I have incurable cancer, two actually I got diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 then Lymphoma in January the worst type of Lymphoma. I’ve been praying constantly for healing and heard in my mind with the first diagnosis I will not let you die my child. I knew it was the Goddess as no one calls me child ever in my entire life, I’m 58 and I’ve had lots of signs in nature which is too much to go into here. I did a spell with a candle for the full lunar cycle, with the specific aim of healing the Lymphoma here in Australia anyway, Lymphoma goes by a number system.

So I was sitting at 20, after two cycles of chemo it went down to 2-3, I’ve just finished my six rounds of chemo and will have a scan in August to see where I’m at. My internal organs were 6 times there normal size so I looked like I was 8 months pregnant, so I was pretty bad but I have no intention of dying and feel that if I was going to die from cancer I already would have.

You have to have faith, I can’t emphasise that enough, just yesterday I found out there was a Saint for cancer, Saint Peregrine so I have added him into my prayers for healing and have him as my screen saver on my iPhone. I’m an eclectic pagan so I work with a lot of different things.

AutumDreaming 76 is right unresolved trauma can and will lead to illness, before I knew I was ill I kept smelling smoke and knew it was a spirit. I read the Tarot but I also Scry with crystals and saw him in my crystal ball blowing out smoke. My tumour was right below my right breast, in a cigar shape. I was in a abusive marriage for 20 years and suffered from depression, I never spoke up and held all these poisonous feelings inside me, and where did the tumour show up above my heart ❤️ 

The first time I thought I was in the clear from cancer four years ago, my husband took me away on a short trip. While we were away I got a tattoo of the Goddess, the guy asked me what it meant. So I explained it and he said my girlfriend has a friend who is right into that sort of thing, I said oh yeah her name is Fiona Horne who is a famous Australian witch for those who don’t know. I said your kidding it was her book I read Life’s a Witch over 20 plus years ago that led me onto this path. We were amazed and I took this as a sign that I was on the right path as I lapsed a bit having met my now husband who I’ve been married to for nearly 21 years. I have to say before I knew I was sick I felt a real pull towards my practice again, now I know why.

Lung damage
Brake dust can damage lung cells and other organs. For example, brake particles that contain asbestos can lead to lung cancer, mesothelioma, or asbestosis.
Reduced immune system
Brake dust can reduce the immune system's ability to fight bacterial infections.
Inflammation
Brake dust can cause inflammation in the lungs.
Cardiovascular disease
Prolonged exposure to brake dust particles may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease.

Telomeres, the guards of your DNA... Science's not secret dirty secret

What are Telomeres? they are chromosomal proteins that cap off the ends of your double helix.

Ok why do i care about them? they are part of the reason you die, directly effect cellular degeneration. Which is why we die, doesnt actually have to be that way though... everytime your cells multiply they become a bit less, this is also how cancer forms, in a way...

what does that have to do with the Annunaki? Genetic manipulation, a ""man made"" change has been done to this structure, twice just on the end.
1 of which you might not notice if you are already deep in it, also known as the God Gene/worship gene, Scientifically known as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 or VMAT2. it is the reason why people are so attuned to following, religious beliefs and religious experiences, submissivness. The theory is that ancient other wordly travelers used the same genetic manipulation that we have learned today to make us more acceptable to rule, obediant, etc. Also like i mentioned lifespan, now limited to 100-120 years from what it was said to be which is closer to 125000-250000 years as the Annunaki were said to have lived. They made us weaker, more susceptible to illness, pain, fatigue, etc.  Im sure i dont need to say that these changes are not natural and not evolution, thatd be the opposite of it.... tortoises live longer than you...just to name one... a turtle dude... they can live to 150 easy ...SMH 😆 i continue anyway

So only 7% (exact number) of our DNA is unique to humans, just 1.5% is unique to our species and shared with everyone. Where did any other bits come from if not evolution..?

What this all suggests is the missin link isnt the ""God of the Gaps"" its Ultrahuman intervention.
Someone did something and we are looking at the result, most simply said. Call them Aliens, call them ancient travelers, call them Annunaki, doesnt matter... only point is Someone with the same and furher knowledge of biological and genetic science did something and we are perceiving it. the work just isnt signed with a written work up so we know the process. 

With everything together if this was a court case the jury would say HE DID IT WITHOUT A DOUBT

scientists are constantly testing skeletons and skulls specifically to determine the RNA make up of what came before us.. do they have X Y, whats the carbon date, can i tell a livelhood from it.. more and more dig sites opening up at these ""old earth"" locations.. also remember we havnt seen everywhere, we have barely dug up the earth so theres a lot more to discover.

Not sure how you handled it with her, but when my wife went to Hospice, we chose to celebrate every moment. We brought in balloons and celebrated birthdays, Christmas, and our Anniversary (she surprised me and had them put her in a special dress). Played music all the time. Sometimes ordered in nice food (Red Lobster). Invited friends and family to visit during specific times. I slept there for the full 25 days she fought. When she couldn't eat solid food anymore, I brought her things like Booster Juice in her favourite flavour, as well as Starbucks tea. Got her some silly toys (plastic clapping hands from the dollar store that she liked to bop me with) as her motor skills were diminishing.

Spend time with him and talk - my biggest regret, I was too focused on meeting needs and getting friends and family in. See if you can find some things that smell like him and store them in a sealed bag. 3 years later, I found some tissue paper (from presents) that smelled like her still; I've since stored them. I have some vacuum sealed clothes I'm going to have a quilt made from someday. With her ash (we used Aquamation, similar to cremation, but more environmentally safe), we had a small urn to keep, necklaces that held ash for a few of us, a few glass oil lanterns with her ash in the glass, as well as glass ""touchstones"" we could carry with us. There was still a very large volume of ash to distribute in Moraine Lake near Banff, Alberta, per her request. Maybe discuss something like this with him so you can hang onto something.

I don't think you have anything to lose and much to gain if you abstain from making any decisions until your emotions have ebbed a good deal.

If you have had 9 good years, then you seem to be very compatible.  Life is tough, relationships are hard work at times.  Can you be sure that you might not have failed your partner in something?  Other couples also have to deal with other kinds of dreadful things, like the death of a child, paralysis, cancer, Alzheimer's ...  This is life.

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don’t how to explain this info, but here’s something. 

I have a different ailment, that I’ve found great success with , and I’m coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it’s conditionally essential. In children it’s much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It’s also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it’s top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn’t scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn’t scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone’s comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‘autoimmune’ diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it’s called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it’s implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in “global protein metabolism” when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability. 

It came to me almost like a soft impulse. I googled LONG COVID TAURINE and the first thing that comes up is this, 

https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2023/10/researchers-identify-amino-acid-that-may-play-key-role-for-predicting-treating-long-covid.html.

I mean taurine isn’t even in the title. There’s something here, it’s super cheap to supplement. Studies have shown use of up to 6g a day. It’s in red meat. It’s in breast milk. I also has lots of other effects and is knock out for cardiovascular health. Just take it, let the community know how it went. This could be promising and if you’re wondering why they didn’t think of this sooner, it’s very recently this mechanism of taurine is new found.",0,1719798659,,,0,lb2eml0,t3_1dsbyo2,t3_1dsbyo2,1719798676,2,False,covidlonghaulers,t5_2wizt3

I figured doing all of that would really make my chances good, along with regular cardio exercise. Here I am, getting a diagnosis early in life. 

I’m talking to functional health experts and they believe I’m infected by parasites by my travels (eating street food and raw fish like sushi) and have SIBO, a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestine. So my immune function has been taxed. So even with all the healthy stuff thrown at it, the parasites had been depleting my nutrients, leaky gut syndrome. They do think bc I did all the healthy stuff, it may be the reason why it is not more advanced, the tumor is still small and no evidence is spread yet. They said if I get rid of the parasites, bacterial overgrowth, and restore acid function, then my immune system should be able to recognize cancer cells in the future and destroy them on my own.

kaylintendo,,,"I would honestly be shocked. I think my cutaway point would be 25; I wouldn't feel concerned, suspicious, or judgmental of a guy who was 25 and still a virgin. But over 25; I'd definitely feel some type of way about it. I'm not saying everyone needs to lose their virginity in high school, or even in college. I'd just be very surprised that they were still a virgin in the years after leaving college.

If I was in my 30's and in the dating field again, I think those feelings would be exacerbated. At that point, I would be concerned at what his reasons might be. 

I would wonder if he remained a virgin for religious reasons; if so, as an atheist, I'd be turned off. 

I might wonder if it was because he was asexual, or if he was the type to only want sex after marriage (without any religious influence; I've met a few guys like that) which are turn offs as someone who does find sex to be an important component in relationships.

If it was neither of those reasons, I'd wonder if he had some kind of tragic event in his life that I might find sympathetic or understandable. Like if he was diagnosed with testicular cancer earlier in his life and developed an insecurity over having sex. Or, if he was the sole caretaker for an elderly/ill family member, and decided it was best to put off dating and relationships to prioritize them.

If there wasn't something reasonable or understandable like that, I'd wonder if the guy has something seriously messed up with him. Is there some type of criminal past that automatically turns women away? Is he abusive? 

Even if the issue was severe social anxiety or some other emotional-based issue, I feel like that's deeply concerning for a 30+ year old man to have. I do expect dating partners in their 30's to be over that kind of shit. Your 20's are for stumbling around, fucking up, and learning how to be a mature adult. If you haven't sorted your stuff out by your 30's, I think it's fair to say that there's a high chance you never will. 

I had a friend in college who was in his 30's, but as I got to know him more, I realized that he was a massive manchild. He did things like creep on college-aged girls while married with kids (to the point where he actually had a Title IX investigation), sold his car and cashed his 401k in order to fund a months-long trip to a foreign country, hold immense resentment for not being elected President for student government, and so on. I gave up on trying to reason with him, and to this day, he still believes he was always in the right, even in the situation where a girl reported him to the Title IX office. I am confident that he will always be that way. When someone is in their early 20's, maybe even mid 20's, I do think there is a good chance for someone to be able to see the error of their ways and ""grow up."" I think those chances are really slim for someone in their 30's.

I understand there are plenty of people who decide to put off dating in order to focus on school or their career for a while, but I'd personally be weirded out if someone decided to wait until they entered their 30's to start dating/having sex. I don't miss the experience of being someone's first girlfriend, and I certainly wouldn't want to deal with it when I'm in my 30's.

I was my ex's first relationship, and he was also a virgin. Although we were much younger (early to mid 20's) I still  ran into a lot of roadblocks because of that difference. It was hard navigating a relationship with someone who was brand new to all this, while I had some previous relationship/dating experience. Things like him wanting to pursue greener pastures and explore his options, overall immaturity, terrible conflict-resolution skills, and insecurities over not having prior dating experiences.",0,1719799919,,,0,lb2hm9x,t3_1dsfuuh,t3_1dsfuuh,1719799935,2,False,AskWomenNoCensor,t5_5w6lwb
Unknown-Drinker,,,"I can see two ""issues"".

1) You have chosen more or less the largest cities in the regions you go through. If there is no exterior reason for that, I would reconsider this approach. Often there are nearby smaller cities/towns that are more interesting than the larger ones.

2) Why no place in Northern Italy? Architecturally it's one of the most interesting places in the world. 

Let me give you two examples of point 1), where I believe there is a nicer small city nearby.

A) Lübeck (or Copenhagen) instead of Hamburg. Hamburg is, from a tourist perspective, very boring. The only thing ""special"" is the red light district, and you'll have that in much bigger in Amsterdam.
Lübeck has decent red brick buildings and is a good representative of a nice city in Northern Germany. Also it has Marzipan.

B) Regensburg instead of Munich. Munich is certainly nice, and you can definitely spend a few days there. However, if you go to Vienna just before it won't be too much of a different experience (Don't get me wrong, certainly Munich is different than Vienna. It's greener and a bit less ""flashy"". But both go into a somewhat similar direction - large city in the Southern part of German speaking Europe, hearty cuisine, former royal residences, both trying to be a bit (too) kitschy for tourists, etc.

Regensburg, on the other hand, offers a different experience - already because of its smaller size. Despite the latter, it has a rich history. It was was one of the major cities of the Holy Roman Empire and has one of the most picturesque Old Towns in Southern Germany. And an impressive gothic cathedral.

In a way, I feel like Lübeck and Regensburg are much better representatives of Northern and Southern Germany than Hamburg and Munich. 
Sure, there is tourism in both (Lü and Re), simply because they are nice places. But it's a bit less ""in your face"" and more relaxed and ""real"" there.
Both are also places that you can do in 1-2 days.

Next, a few things to do in the places I know best (Munich, Regensburg, Amsterdam):

So, if you nevertheless want to go to Munich,
these are some interesting places that you will not find among the first suggestions in a tourist guide (since Munich is touristy enough, you'll find the standard tourist things easily with a Google search):

- coffins of the Bavarian kings in the crypt of St. Michael
- Asamkirche (Baroque church that gives you eye cancer)
- Schelling-salon (a place for ""the people"", that both Lenin and the failed artist went to - although not together, I assume)
- Gallery of Beauties in Nymphenburg Palace (maybe 19th century pornhub?)
- also, I recommend NOT going to the Hofbräuhaus. It's tourist trap No. 1 and overly cliché. Something like Hackerhaus or Augustinerkeller are more authentic alternatives.

Now, things to do in Regensburg are:
- eat sausages at the Wurstkuchl (centuries-old sausage kiosk)
- visit the cathedral incl. crypt
- guided tour of the Old Town about the city's history 
- the Old Townhall (a historic place, internal politics of the HRE were done here)
- Salzstadl (they used to store salt here)
- Walhalla (a bit outside, very nice view, combine perhaps with a short hike)
- Rauschgold if you're into clubbing and German 'Schlager' music
- St. Emmeram Palace (if you don't mind the owner being a billionaire with bizarre political views)

Finally, since it's also part of your itinerary, a few things to do in Amsterdam are:
- the red light district
- Albert Cuyp market (eat (broodje) haring, there)
- smoke weed, eat cheese (both are good in Holland. Be careful with taking weed with you though, the legal situation differs across countries)
- ARTIS Micropia (zoo for microbes, a truly fascinating place)
- anything with paintings, I assume (I'm not into art, so cannot really tell much about that)
- Anne Frank house (book tickets in advance)
- boat tour on the canals
- the city center is crap! Ofc, it's canals and nice old buildings, but the latter are filled with either coffeeshops or the same generic stores you find in every major city. Also way too crowded and it smells. More interesting quarters to stroll around are 'Jordaan' and 'De Pijp'
- Sadly, from a culinary perspective Dutch food is, for the most part, a major offense to even a mediocre palate. However, Satékroket (at any Snack bar) and Dark Chocomel (in the omnipresent Albert Heijn supermarkets) are among the exceptions",0,1719799973,,,0,lb2hqyv,t3_1ds0ovl,t3_1ds0ovl,1719799988,2,False,Interrail,t5_2rv8d

PittieMama88,,,"No attorney, just myself and my partner. The judge asked my partner to leave until the end, so I was mostly there by myself. 

He mentioned multiple times that the level of harassment that I described probably didn't rise to the level of needing a restraining order, especially since I didn't have proof that she threw the paint on my car. There were also a couple of events that I described that he said he wasn't even going to consider as harassment because they were harmless. One of those instances was that she put an empty, open green bean can on top of our trash can outside. It wasn't threatening or criminal, but it was weird, so I included it. I think he was leaning towards more of a ""just leave each other alone"" kind of warning. 

It's quite possible that he was just being impartial until he heard from both sides. I'm just a very anxious person, so I took his comments to lean towards a denial. 

When it was her turn to speak, he asked her about the paint, and she denied it. Then he asked her why she is always yelling at us, and she launched into all of these accusations. Some were:

1. We are stealing her electricity. She has dug up all of the electrical lines surrounding her house, and they lead to our house. The electric company apparently agreed with her and wrote up a whole report about it, but she couldn't find it.

2. The green bean can. She accused my partner of cutting a hatch into her roof, with hinges, so that he can enter her house any time he wants. He apparently goes through her stuff, steals things (including her underwear), and dents her canned goods. She left the green bean can so she could show my partner that she saw the dents. 

3. She described the multiple times per month that she calls the cops on us for stealing her electricity and breaking into her house. 

4. She said we are drug manufacturers that built a new fence with the bottom missing so that the fumes would blow directly underneath and into her yard. We do this so that she gets cancer. 

5. My partner waits until her dogs are in the middle of pooping, then he jumps the fence into her yard and hits them. 

6. We scatter rocks into her yard so that she trips and falls.

Defiant_Brother_1172,,,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom’s diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven’t really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

CrazyCartwheels,,,"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",0,1719829305,,,0,lb3uq8l,t3_1dso4rv,t3_1dso4rv,1719829321,3,False,ProstateCancer,t5_2s1qy

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

Garokson,,,"My Standard recommendation list:

* **Death after Death**: This is a very good darker gamelit isekai subversion that actually has some great character developement. In here a pro-gamer let's himself be reincarnated in a roguelike dungeon reality by truck-kun. But what when it actually turns out that your gamer knowledge isn't worth much? Watch how the MC comes slowly to this realization while trying to escape the hellhole he explicitly wished for. In true roguelike fashion of course. Namely Death. By Death. By Death. By Death. By Death.
* **Godclads**: In a world where the 1% wear the remains of lobotomized gods as a mantle of power, where baseline humans are just cattle to feed the soulforges, where intimacy is retributed by an eldritch plague, where technology is powered by mind-breaking necromancy, it takes a special someone to upend the status quo. But who would have thought that a cannibalistic ghoul actually had the decency to do something against it?
* **Chosen One Protective Services:** What do you think would happen when Wizards weren't the kind gandalfian mentors that chose and protect you but instead con artists that chose you to get new young fodder for their brutal dungeons? Poor Rusty will show you the full abject terror of it. But what happens to the ones left behind? Watch his heavily burnt brother Cyrus claw himself through ordeals just to get his sweet baby brother back and find out.
* **On Foreign Soils We Die**: Ever wondered what would happen when a world war 2 country ruled by Dragonborn get's declared war by another country that uses isekai murderhobos against them? When system favored people that murder draconic gods for sport, facetank artilleryshells and call upon the wrath of the sun god invade? Well, tune in and find out.
* **Source & Soul: A Deckbuilding LitRPG:** There are really only a select few turn based card battler - real card battler - stories in the LitRPG genre and this is the first one that actually makes it work. The two MC's, a sidelined third son of a noble family and a abused street urchin down on his luck, are both well and immersively written so that you just want to keep reading. Even the character growth is real. I also really like that they aren't genius players right from the get go and actually can lose or misplay their matches. There aren't even bullshit lootbox mechanics that only are there to shove random super powerful and undeserved cards into the MC's pockets. So their power really feels at some point quite deserved. The system itself is sufficiently complex to allow theorycrafting but not overwhelming. The battles are, thanks to the mechanics, quite fast paced and are over in one or two chapters. And yes I also wouldn't have thought to ever say this ... fast paced card battles. So all in all I can only recommend this.
* **Tenebroum**: Finally a good Necromancer story that is as evil as they come and more importantly without being edgy. Watch this story about a resentful wraith trying to get vengeance for his brutal murder. If he just could remember it. So why not go for corrupting the living and subjugating the world instead?
* **Toad Town**: What would you get when you combined a mentally damaged system, a fat dungeon fairy, a mutated goose as well as an inbred toad without any kind of ethics that got reincarnated as a buggy dungeon settlement core? Gutwrenching fun. That's what you get.
* **The Cabin Is Always Hungry**: Forget carousel, this seems to be the new and upcoming great horror litrpg with the ritually sacrified main character - who became a dungeon core - actively having to realistically re-enact slasher horror movies to level and survive.
* **Elydes:** A very nice slow burn LitRPG with a good progession-ish skillsystem. It starts out with a cancer patient being reincarnated on a beautiful island nation where he know get's the chance to live a full life. Well if there wasn't imperialism and tragedy threatening him and his family. Watch how this young MC actually works and claws himself through the system and world while actually earning his steelclad will.
* **Vae Victis**: Marianne, a vampire trained by the south american mafia, got basically isekai'ed into a high leveled jungle and is now on a survival spree. Add a unique class system that is based on masks and fusing them with their subclasses called 'ornaments' and I was completely hooked. It's written by the author of IR so it's prose is quite good.
* **Vainqueur the Dragon:** A satire about litrpgs and isekais where a dumb and greedy Red Dragon forces a thief to help him to become an adventurer for the looot while making short work out of each an every rpg and isekai trope you can think off.
* **Threadbare 1-3 / Small Medium 1-3 / Blasphemy Online 1-3 / Threadbare 4-6:** All of these play in Generica and are interwined. It has a very good system were you can level by combining jobs. E.g. You can be a Knight and a Necromancer which are tier 1 jobs. If you're then buffing your undead from horseback with knight skills you unlock the tier 2 Death Knight job and so on. The stories themselves are very humorous and well written. The first is about a sentinent teddy bear golem that has to save his little girl and does this by accidentally becoming a necromancer. The second is about a Small Medium at Large - so she is basically a hobbit with grifter and luck manipulation skills that has to save the village that's getting attacked. The third is about a player becoming a dragon but due to some mysterious circumstances the npc controls his body in the RL while the MC is ingame. In Threadbare 4 all these threads are then combined which promises an even better story.
* **Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends:** This one has one of the best skill trees to date. You basically have three pillars. Classes that give you abilities, cultivation that gives you techniques and skills like |Evade| or |Darkvision| that are based on your understanding of them. You can now mix and match these three pillars to create truly diverse and unique builds. E.g. there has been an enemy that could summon stone axes and armors with his cultivation to fight with, while his class gave him the power to reap the experience from his enemies. Another one is a dexterous dual wielder that got ethereal powers from his class, reflex and combat buffs from his cultivation and supports this with skills like Evasion and Fighting Styles. So he basically became a uber mobile dodge tanky striker with teleportation powers. The story is also great. It's basically about gods being bored and thus decided to create a few unvierses for their entertainment. At a certain point in time the universe get's crashed by the Framework and they're told that only the 10.000 strongest will be teleported to the next world where they have to compete against each other until the big finale starts. 
* **Apocalypse Tamer:** A satirical, quite funny and at times grimm mixture of a system apocalypse, a dude that just wants to live with his pet pokemon and annoying monsters that just don't let him live in peace.
* **Deadman:** A LitRPG in the style of a full fledged Fallout game experienced out of the eyes of a ghoul.
* **The Hedge Wizard**: More of a gamelit but this story of a wandering mage reads *exactly* like a good DnD game which each book being it's own full campaign from start to finish.
* **Demon Card Enforcer:** Do you want a darker and action packed neo noir card battler with copious amounts of good boy demon doggos, mobsters, leveling deckbuilding, half dead protagonists and bullets to the head? Oh god so many bullet to the head of people. Then this might be something for you.",0,1719832574,,,0,lb401fu,t3_1dsp468,t1_lb3w7up,1719832591,12,False,ProgressionFantasy,t5_x7vh9
White-tigress,,,"Ok.  SO.  Long one incoming but it WILL answer your question and the answer is yes.  

Oh but Tigress, you ask, how could you POSSIBLY know?  

Well, dear friend,  I was in medical weight management programs for 8 years, eating 600 to 800 calories a day and less than 40 carbs with no weight loss at all.  By no weight loss I mean, it was a surprise when I dropped 1 pounds over a full 6 months. PLUS I was on 3 weight loss medication, including one of the supposed miracle GLP1.  And yes I did say YEARS.  8 YEARS.  In the middle of this time I moved to a new city and had to start over with a new doctor who had to document all over again nothing working.  Once he got there, he then spent, I am not joking here, 3 years sending me to doctors for tests.  ALL THE F*ING TESTS.  I call it 3 years of hell.  Hormone, blood, nutritional, scopes, biopsies, swallow, sleep, swallow with radiation for 5 hours, sonogram, CT, neurological, insulin, anemia, and bacteria or parasite.  I was at the hospital 3 or 4 days a week either doing an intake, doing a test, or getting the results of a test.  Every test came back normal.  Every.  Last.  Test. Except one in my stomach for a common virus call H. Pylori that it took months and 3 rounds of such caustic antibiotics to cure that I have PTSD from taking them.  They took me 3 months to recover from taking the antibiotics.  But that had no bearing on the weight loss it was a side quest!! At this point he decides I must have a tumor.  I am so depressed I can’t lose weight and in pain and exhausted from tests I am actually begging to have cancer because I just need an answer.  Remember, we are almost a decade in.  So they send me to a CT scan with contrast dye (where they blow out my veins several times) and and MRI both.  Guess what!!!  Both are clear.  No cysts or tumors.  No cancer.  I should be happy but I sobbed.  Finally, having exhausted all other tests, he says he can run a genetic panel,  looking for markers of obesity or genetic disorders.  Ironically, it was the ONLY test that wasn’t painful and exhausting.  

To say, when that test came back with a rare genetic mutation, I was overwhelmed with emotions, is the understatement of understatements.  Then to find out it kills most people in birth, and those that survive die in or before puberty, was staggering.  I still get letters from genetic laboratories asking if they can study me.  

So, my doctor says my only hope is bariatric surgery.  I say “but nothing else worked.  How can this?”  So I put off the referral to surgery for 8 months to do research. I have a genetic mutation nothing else touched.  I better know my shot before I take it.

Turns out it works for lots of reasons.  It is not just restriction.   

It cuts the nerves in the stomach completely turning off and resetting metabolism, like rebooting a computer.

Urologist recommended removing them just to make sure there was no cancer.

Since no cancer was initially detected on ultrasound an inguinal incision to remove my balls was not done and they were removed via a scrotal incision.

Pathology exam thankfully revealed no cancer.

So, while stirring and alcohol injections did destroy my balls and eliminated testosterone, the original objective, it ultimately resulted in castration, not the original or desired goal.

Cancer kills you by taking away the nutrients before healthy cells get them (sort of). But the mutant cells might be regenerating fast enough to also steal the energy from cancer cells.

This reminds me of a discovery we found that larger animals die less often of cancer than small animals. The short version of this discovery was that cancer can grow cancer cells themselves so the two cancers compete and kill each other.

In Deadpools case the ""second cancer"" would be his mutated cells that are mutated cells and technically not cancer.

xenonrealitycolor,,,"This is honestly pretty cool, but bci suffers from interface disconnect issues over time, which sucks. If they could use electrostatic free electrons introduced that then get captured as moving static charge changes deep in the brain with electromagnetic field pulses that collapse inwards then are opened back up with a counter rotating opposite polarity field (the field spin is counter rotating, yes, but the polarity changes north versus south) that is weak but made to propagate forwards through the brain using lensing techniques (like the majority of the field is pointed one direction, that 1800s dude that did it then named it after himself) but with phasing techniques to have it elongate and shift backwards would be phenomenal to help with watching real time brain wave, blood, and neuron activation. But you need to push some vibrations, using infrasonic, midsonic, & ultrasonic to specifically help with light wave frequency targeting for wave frequency alteration to multiple nano size areas through multidirectional ""fluidic grid weaving"" liquid light states that drop out and collapse to wake field propagation towards sensors and detectors that no longer need to be hyper sensitive with extreme light wave lengths that are ionizing and cancerous.

This maps the brain accurately without damaging it, controlling it, and in real time wirelessly acts as an interface for the brain control of a computer. No invasive surgery. Just time on, decent initial calculations, them like this is talking about ai data set build up of known over and over thought patterns and so on until it can finally understand what the person is saying at all times.

Perfectly. Or nearly. But there is a catch! It's a lot of data collected, takes a while to do it, and it basically is a full ""snapshot"" of a person's whole self. Think, non destroyed brain mapping after life. The version of them can live in there, but the version that is their experience loving in their body dies and fully experiences that while being completely (ish) different than that person in there. Anyways, I only allow for it to be broken up and chunked so there's is no aware self, no real person there. But they can be reassembled and constantly updated until the end, I guess. Usually I go hard, and use long distance versions of the wireless so it's always up to date, no matter what. We can always reassemble the biological brain, inputting would be like this but with active force applied to areas, electricity, light collapse, but another important part of the puzzle... Quantum electromagnetic field wave collapse from looping brain wave and neuron connections, combined with neuron activation to start a break out of processing waves and memory formation. 

Basically the loopy nature of the neurons and the connections for memories and thought processing creates quantum charge and electromagnetic fields that synchronize by resonance & eliciting light from microtubules (yes) but also from how free electrons & electron hole pairs work, keeping the quantum phenomenon continuing in a sequence and around far longer. So it actually does things, even helps with processing, memory formation and getting back if areas are damaged, ionic potential for chemical reactions, and is outright massive in ""jumpstarting"" the brain to ""waking up"" into being the original person. Otherwise, they are just someone that is a baby as an adult. 

Bright side, new people can be put in like that Netflix show travelers. Even from afar, like them. Oh also, growing stem cells in the brain by using a forced mitosis to DNA replication sequence to stem cells change works best. Crisp-r cas9 can work but the protein that sequences the 2 split DNA strands being altered to turn them into down cells and check telomere lengths and fix them is the best and easiest way to do it, same for parkinson's and Alzheimer's and dementia. I usually just train the immune system to attack and eat those proteins by culturing them in a petri dish with the misfolded proteins attached to the cell membranes of dead or alive neurons/bacteria. Our immune system doesn't get into our brains, so if they come out it reduces them in the body. But we have an different type of immune system in our brains, other neuron cells that attack too, so I tend to use that in the petri dish with signifiers (proteins and peptides, so on) and then inject / place these into the ""memory cells"" of the immune system. Basically our immune system ""uploads"" that immune system ""memory"" back into the cells pretty often as we replace them all the time, so by doing this it injects a ""new update code"" into the cells really quick and makes sure they don't proliferate. Still it does mean that's your immune system is fighting off something all the time.

Here's a passage where he speaks to the coherence and importance of the notion (p. 57):

>What seems clear however is that, firstly, viewed through a macro-lens our world appears to be probabilistic and, secondly, in light of the fact that probabilistic theories prevail at every level all the way down to QM, it’s doubtful whether, even if we knew enough of the fine details of the universe, we’d be able to uncover sufficient (or indeed necessary) causes for each effect.

>To illustrate, consider the causal relation between asbestos inhalation and mesothelioma. The process by which the former brings about the latter is complex, and there isn’t yet consensus on the details. But one study suggests the following. Asbestos is toxic to human mesothelial cells (which line the pleural cavities in the lungs). The damage that asbestos fibres do to these cells results in the protein HMGB1 being released from them. The presence of extracellular HMGB1 leads macrophages (a type of white blood cell) to release another protein, TNF-A. TNF-A activates NF-kB in damaged mesothelial cells. Activated NF-kB helps some of these damaged cells to survive. These damaged cells can then develop into cancer cells.

>Assume that some picture like this is right. Then, even in the case of an individual person, the causal process by which asbestos exposure can bring about mesothelioma is probabilistic. It depends, for instance, upon the ‘random walks’ followed by asbestos fibres experiencing Brownian motion in the air and in the lungs. It depends upon the probabilistic process of osmosis (of HMGB1 and TNF-A), which comes under the purview of statistical mechanics. And it depends upon molecular bonding processes (which are involved in the stimulation of macrophages by HMGB1, and in the activation of NF-kB by TNF-A), which are subject to QM probabilities.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,,,0,lb4a5q7,t3_1dslxx8,t1_lb3onwa,1719837681,2,False,cancer,t5_2qixx

roymondous,vegan,vegan,">The individual does matter. 

>Whatever benefits the majority of individuals is the best decision. 

Right. So the individual doesn't matter. In and of themselves. In utilitarian philosophy. You can harm the individual if there's benefit to others. In the actual example I gave you, the individual didn't matter. You mixed them up. You shooting a deer does not stop an additional deer being predated as you initially said. 

>Population control heavily benefits the herd, and every animal given a good death benefits in that way.

""A good death"". Again, wonder if they'd think that. Or if they'd prefer to live, be with their babies, and be with their herd for longer. You are describing this in such weird ways. 

>Dominant males of herds (for deer in this scenario) rarely chase after predators unless they're cornered or too tired to run any more. Even if they did try to protect the herd, they're at a huge risk of injury or death themselves, so there's no difference. The protection is in the numbers of the herd, not an individual trying to protect it.

More assumptions. You clearly haven't researched the topic, as shown by your ignorance of just how much hunting contributed, among other issues. I don't care about your opinion. It does not matter in this discussion. 

>Option 1: 99% of wild animals die horrible deaths, but maybe some live a little bit longer.

Again, random numbers pulled out your ass. Please do a bit of research before making claims about who you can kill. You are assuming you have the moral right to decide who lives and dies - against the will of that animal (yes, comparisons to humans are valid). You require VER Ygood arguments to morally justify yourself in saying 'I have the moral right to kill you for your own benefit even if you don't want it'. 

>Option 2: Animals killed by hunters get to die a good death but die a little bit sooner. The others continue to die horrible deaths that they were *already guaranteed*. Maybe they die a bit sooner too, it really doesn't make much of a difference.

A ""good death"" is a bunch of bullshit. Again, 

>We euthanize animals all the time, our pets. We make the best compassionate decision with the options we have. It just so happens that the most compassionate and realistic option for wild animals is a bullet instead of a medication.

It doesn't ""just so happen"". We aren't talking of a pet with cancer or something that means they will be suffering every moment. We are talking of a deer in it's prime, with young to care for, as part of a herd, and with happy and sad and joyous and painful moments. Most of all, an animal that does not want to die.

It is your opinion based on nothing at all. You've given random numbers and no actual data or evidence. 99% of statistics are made up.

susevda,,,"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

Here is what I know- that’s a fairly high ki score.  Your cancer was hormone fed, our body produces hormones in our ovaries and adrenal glands. Your body producing hormones is like throwing cheeseburgers at cancer- it can feed it. The purpose of the hormone blockers is to reduce the chance of it coming back.

We were raised that way. My mother was extremely abusive to my brother and I. She once held me high in the air by my throat in front of the rest of my siblings as a lesson. My brother is disabled. Sometimes, she'd had enough of him. Lock both her and himself in a room together. The screams I'd hear from him being beaten haunt me to this day. She once made me eat dog shit. I try and blame it on the fact that she had ptsd from the war, just to cope with the fact that my mother hated us and never wanted children. My father committed $uicide when I was 4 years old. Since then, a couple of men tried to fill his place in my mother's eyes. Recently, my sisters confessed to me that not only have those men sexually assaulted them, but my mother knew about it and chose to do nothing. 
She kicked us out of the house this year because I didn't want to live under the same roof as a sexual predator.

I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

And yes, the majority of women do give up breastfeeding in the UK. But do you know what? A lot of those women also say they gave up BEFORE they WANTED to.

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I’m making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I’ve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I’m in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60’s. I’d like to think that I’ve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo’s, one 14yo). It’s all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it’s a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won’t really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we’d have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we’ve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I’m very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don’t particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I’ve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I’ve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life…I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what’s the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They’ll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they’d have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

A global pandemic that was seriously mishandled by trump who completely disregarded the play book to handle such a situation because it was created by his predecessor. Because of his incompetence many people lost their jobs, and many others lost their lives. 

>Inflation through the roof

Inflation has been happening all over the world, not just the US. 

>Prices of everything are sky high while income isn’t up 

Why are you blaming the president instead of the corporations that are raising the prices of everything despite showing record profits? Speaking of income, which party keeps fighting against raising the minimum wage? It isn't the democrats.

>Medical supplies are at an all time high. Healthcare at all time high. 

And which party wants to tank the ACA and refuses to allow price negotiations on those supplies? Again - not the democrats. 

>Wants to get rid of tax cuts? What president says that lol? 

You mean the tax cuts that grossly inflated our deficit? 

>Embarrassment throughout the world. 

That was the other guy. 

>The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a national embarrassment and a shame on his part. 

That was negotiated by trump and scheduled to happen after he left office. 

>The mass funding of people’s wars is an embarrassment. 

Even more embarrassing is that trump knew putin was planning to invade a neighboring country and didn't say or do anything to discourage it because they're besties.

>Immigration worse than ever resulting in people being killed by immigrants on a DAILY basis. 

Illegal immigration is down. People are killed by other fully American citizens on the daily as well. 

>Not to mention the fact that he is cognitively gone. 

Right... like the gish galloping word salad trump spits makes a lot of sense. He completely failed to answer the questions he was asked during the debate, and his rants about being electrocuted by boat batteries and windmills causing cancer are lunacy.

ZebraZealousideal558,,,"I did look into abnormal paps after I had my first but that was in 2009 but don’t recall much education about HPV until the vaccine became a big deal. When I got the vaccine it was only for women and my memory is that at that time HPV was only harmful to women. Or at least that was my 19 year old self interpretation of it. 

I did do research again in 2019, again I don’t recall there being much of an emphasis of the impact on men and if 8 remember correctly the idea that men are mostly carriers was prominent. My boyfriend at the time was aware of my diagnosis, but again there was never the thought it put him at risk of anything. I thought I was going to be with him forever so never really considered additional transmission. 

I didn’t start dating again until late 2020, after my negative HPV results in 2020. I had two partners before my next positive HPV result in 2022. Honestly I didn’t start seeing information about informing partners until I started doing extensive research when I had pre-cancer cells. I’ve really only seen info about informing partners since looking at Reddit threads about CIN and experiences with that. I recall even being told by my doctor at one point that informing people wasn’t necessary since it was “so common.”

In hindsight, I’m Trying to take some responsibility for this. I’m generally a pretty knowledgeable person about healthcare and thought I was a considerate person.  I’d never want to knowingly put someone at risk.

First, this documentary:

- Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani (2020)

An ideal, a pioneer, an Albert Einstein or Alan Turing of hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry in mathematics, with an unbelievably inspiring story. She serves as an inspiration to numerous female students all over the world, and many awards are presented in her honor. Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani, a young woman who was honored with the Fields Medal (even while battling cancer, she didn't give up), won 2 gold medals at the International Olympiad of Mathematics, achieving a full mark! Scientists often describe her work as wielding a magic wand. Sadly, she passed away a few years ago at a young age due to cancer.

May 12, the International Women in Mathematics Day, marks the birthday of the award-winning mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani.

This documentary tells the story of her life, the education system, politics, etc. It doesn't capture the whole culture, but it highlights one of the main parts, especially the lives of teenagers (interviewed with students).

Directed by George Paul Csicsery. Filmed in Canada, Iran, and the United States.


Other options first shot:

- Interstellar 

The black hole simulation is currently part of some astronomy courses in some universities.""


Second shots:

- The Theory of Everything
- The Imitation Game

- The Martian (2015)

- Arrival (2016)
- GATTACA - Genetics is not everything. There are also epigenetic factors

We as a species weren't designed to be powered by Sugar, the most addictive substance in the world. Sure it will sustain you just as my ancestors lived/ survived on Potatoes.

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

Laughing at how ACCURATE you are. 

Because.... I AM THE RESULTS of doctor NEGLECT! 

I was 16 years old when I got this disease and absolutely NO ONE even knew what it was. 
I was out on birth control because they had NO CLUE what to do. 

I did NOT get a formal PCOS diagnosis until I was THIRTY THREE (33) years old. 

I was having ALL of my reproductive organs removed BEFORE I turned 35.
Because of.... CANCER! 

PCOS doesn't cause pain? 

Sure! 
Shall we go through the checklist of MEDICAL CONDITIONS PCOS CAUSES! 

Sleep Apnea 
Acid reflux disease 
Lymphedema 
Diabetes 
Dental damage
Bone weakness
Cancer

What does sleep apnea do? 
Oh, it only CAUSES YOUR HEART TO SLOW DOWN! Which can cause PARTS OF YOUR HEART TO NOT WORK RIGHT! 

Acid reflux disease? That comes with a hiatal hernia and a SPLIT DIAPHRAGM! 

Lymphedema. Has ANYONE here experienced leg swelling so bad that the pores in your leg start RAINING LIKE A FAUCET down their leg. 
I have. It was EXTREMELY PAINFUL. 

Diabetes. This? Oh, this only leads to KIDNEY DEATH! 

Diabetes is the ONLY disease on this list I DON'T have. 
Why? 
I watched my father DIE FROM THIS! 
He became diabetic and after 30 years his KIDNEYS DIED! 
Resulting in the last 6 years of his life to be on KIDNEY DIALYSIS! 3 days a week. FOR LIFE! 
Until it CAUSED HIS HEART TO NOT FUNCTION RIGHT! And NEEDED a pacemaker and that STILL DID NOT WORK!
BLOOD POISONING!
Frequent trips to get the port for dialysis fixed because it kept clogging up.
It LITERALLY KILLS YOU!

PCOS DESTROYS Dentin. IE Teeth! 

Bone? PCOS weakens bone. 
To the point they are EASILY BROKEN! 

And one of my favorite topics. 
Cancer. 

NO one ""gets"" cancer because EVERYONE is born with cancer. 
Cancer is antigens that is literally part of the bodies DNA.

Uterine cancer is also known as marker CA 125.

Every type of cancer has a marker and they can mutate and become cancer at any given time. 

Been down this road and literally waiting for breast cancer to show up. 
Just so I can CHOP THEM OFF! 

I know all this because from 33 to 36 I had a REAL OBGYN and she taught me everything. 
Then my insurance changed and I could no longer see her. 

I have NOT had an OB since. But. I also have NO reproductive organs to concern myself with. 

I am the RESULT of YEARS of NEGLECT! 

This is what UNTREATED PCOS LEADS TO! 

A LIFE of medical disability and PAIN! 
Oh, and I am ONLY 46.

And ... Studies have PROVEN that PCOS leads to an EARLY DEATH! 
Meaning WE DIE sooner. 

And the goddamn doctors are LAYING IN THEIR AZZES. Still treating us as if it's some big goddamn JOKE! 

There is ONLY so much I can have removed or cut off before I literally limit my life to being stuck confined to a bed. 

Sorry, I get very into explaining this disease because I have LIVED with it since 16 and SUFFERED until a doctor FINALLY took me seriously. 
It was only SEVENTEEN years TOO LATE! 

And now, I am so sick EVERY DAY! 
The acid reflux disease is SO BAD it's in the entire lining of my stomach. 

I CAN'T take any medication orally because my stomach WON'T allow it

starfish11111111,,,"Reading everyone’s comments here have been a huge comfort to me.. I started to realize that we all share so much in common. 

Cancer has changed everything. 

I lived with my partner when I first got diagnosed last year (+++). I don’t know if it was the stress of it all or what but I ended up moving after my DMX and before radiation. (Never underestimate the power of a person who has had enough bullshit lol). I learned that he was unable to support me at the worst time of my life.. and I hate to admit this but I don’t know if I would have left if it weren’t for the cancer. It was the cancer that gave me the push to just get out of a not so great (for me) situation. I’m actually really thankful for that. 

My coworkers were amazing during the entire process and I couldn’t be more thankful. Thing is about work.. it’s hard now to go to work. You are faced with this terrible news and it makes you contemplate what is important. Work just seems so… useless. Alas I live in the US and work is tired to insurance. Which we know we need.. so it’s a double edge sword. I know I have to go, but I’ve been more mindful about what I actually WANT to do now vs what I thought I should do before. 

I was a person who lived for others and relationships before. I know that’s not the way to have healthy relationships, but hey, that’s for another sub haha. I now spend time doing things I like. I run, bike and do everything outside because that’s what I enjoy. I think now I’m learning to slowly let go of things that don’t make me happy. In some ways that to me feels selfish but I know it’s the way.

vagueink,,,"Correct, the digestive tract isn’t 100% efficient so your previous statements about calories in/calories out are quite empty. You asked where the energy went. I told you, now you seem to be co-opting my point. Energy in doesn’t always mean energy out and carbohydrates are the effective energy mechanism…not protein in reasonable doses and not fiber in any dose. Point made hopefully.

Functional medicine definitely isn’t quackery and has cured more serious issues personally and within my rather large circle than conventional medicine. I’ve seen it put autoimmune disorders and cancer into remission and at present it’s the best hope for curing ALZ. The white wolf of conventional medicine. There’s a reason why the richest among us have abandoned conventional medicine when looking at life extension and innovation in the field of medicine and why very little of it is being done in heavily regulated western countries. My basic guess is that conventional medicine and by extension conventional research has been co-opted by capitalism and then kneecapped by regulation. Share holders, political lobbyists and university endowments influencing medicine is a horrible blend of idiocy. It’s great you’ve picked a noble field but my guess is you won’t innovate much until you wake up from conventional thought. I hope you prove me wrong but it’s more likely you just keep pushing the rock up the hill looking for the magic pill that cures a lack of mindfulness in the masses. 

If you are unwilling to receive my anecdotal lead (your words) I’ve presented you and instead use a fairly shallow Wikipedia post to attempt to make your point, then I believe my original reply holds true. You should experience for yourself rather than just read. It’s not hard to fast. You’re a researcher, research for real. Also, as a researcher you should be ashamed for using Wikipedia as a source. Give Dr Dale Bredesen a read if you want a nice introduction into what functional medicine actually means.

Detoxing isn’t a myth, that’s absurd, it’s simply a term used to encompass a process used to encourage the elimination of unwanted things in the body. I’ve experienced it first hand as have many of my circle and millions around the world. Ours  definitions might differ but a simple example (by my definition) would be the use autophagy to eat cancer cells and dispel toxic waste. Conventional medicine uses radiation and now designs vaccines to cure cancer while the mechanism to clean the body of unwanted cellular growth is as simple as letting itself, eat itself. Why wouldn’t this be shared with NPCs? Because there’s not much money in telling people who suffer from chronic issues to just stop eating carbohydrates. Full circle.

I really hope you never have to experience the major limitations of conventional medicine/research yourself but if you do I hope you remember this post and mix it up a bit. It might save your life or the life of someone you really love in such a simple way. 

Feel free to launch more things you’ve read on the internet but never experienced for yourself at me. It won’t sway my wisdom but it will make my point.

She seemed to more defend William during the disappearance. Like when people suggested she disappeared for domestic violence reasons.

Mom has been ill for a few years with rheumatoid arthritis. My family has been quite dysfunctional and with a lot of problems. Mom got sued by the municipality because she stopped paying rent and eviction was imminent, brother got diagnosed with cancer and passed a way. I came back from abroad and lived at my mom’s for a while but it was full of conflict and problems. Got kicked out of her house once. My mental health was deteriorating, I was working for a call centre and doing a lot of commuting. Whenever I’d get home there would be no rest because my was always shouting and calling for my brother to help her with this and that. At this time, eviction was still imminent. I was back living with her and my brother but the environment and energy was not right. Despite all of that, I started talking to my mom about finding a place to live and that any time they could knock and we would be out on the streets. She told me she was not going to live with me. I found a flat and got my brother to come and see it. We agreed we would split the deposit for the house. I pay the deposit in advance because I don’t want to lose the house. My brother than turns around and tells me he’s going to live with mom and my sister (whom I don’t have a relationship with). I confronted my
mom and she told me ""i told you i was not going to live with you"".  So i was stuck with a flat, and very little money. I had to get over the heartbreak, betrayal and confusion and find w flatmate, which i did. 

Almost a year goes by and mom is still living with my siblings at the house they were meant to be evicted from. they get the last eviction notice and my mom calls me and tells me she needs to talk with me. i told her theres's nothing to talk about, i'm moving to another place to be closer to work and im giving the key to the flat soon. i will be living with a flatmate and there is no space for her.

a few months go by and i find out mom, brother and sister bought a house together. the house is in my sister's name, my mom gave her 10k, and my brother got a loan from the bank so they could have enough deposit. They moved in together and things go left very quickly. My mom needs a lot of support, sister and brother are ignoring her and don’t help her with anything. Sister threatens to kick my mom out all the time. Mom is sinking in depression. Calls me all the time crying. Sister decides to renovate house so the three of them have to move out for 2 months. 

In the meantime, I got new job, higher salary, flatmate moved out and I’m living alone in a nice apartment. Mom has asked to move in with me, I told her that’s not happening because my boyfriend at the time was meant to move in with me. We have now broken up. Family members are calling me telling me I should take my mom in. 

AITA for not wanting her to move in after everything that has happened? Especially after they let me put  a 2k deposit down?

VariationForeign1673,default,Layperson/not verified as healthcare professional,"She could possibly be suffering from Anemia... FYI if you are not familiar with this disease already.
Anemia is a condition that occurs when the body doesn't produce enough healthy red blood cells or the red blood cells don't function properly. This prevents the body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood, which can lead to a number of symptoms:
Fatigue: Feeling weak or tired
Shortness of breath: Difficulty breathing
Dizziness: Feeling lightheaded
Headaches: Pain in the head
Irregular heartbeat: A fast or abnormal heart rate Other symptoms include:
Difficulty concentrating
Irritability
Loss of appetite
Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet
Pale skin
Cold extremities 
Mild anemia or anemia that develops slowly may not have any symptoms. However, if left unchecked, anemia can become serious and feel like a heart attack. A blood test can measure hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell levels to determine if anemia is present. 
Risk factors for anemia include:
Poor diet, Intestinal disorders, Chronic diseases, Infections, Menstruation or pregnancy, Chronic medical conditions, Age, Autoimmune diseases, Kidney disease, and Cancer. 
The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which can be caused by blood loss, poor iron absorption, pregnancy, or gastric bypass surgery. Treatments for anemia vary depending on the type of anemia, but may include medication, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, surgery, painkillers, supplements, or oxygen therapy.


Other symptoms include:
Difficulty concentrating
Irritability
Loss of appetite
Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet

Poor diet, Intestinal disorders, Chronic diseases, Infections, Menstruation or pregnancy, Chronic medical conditions, Age, Autoimmune diseases, Kidney disease, and Cancer. 
The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which can be caused by blood loss, poor iron absorption, pregnancy, or gastric bypass surgery. Treatments for anemia vary depending on the type of anemia, but may include medication, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, surgery, painkillers, supplements, or oxygen therapy.",0,1719847231,,,0,lb4zgo3,t3_1dopyrc,t1_labit97,1719847247,1,False,AskDocs,t5_2xtuc

That’s KGB Kompromat methodology that was repeated with trump since the days of ray Cohn (his mentor) and the early Russian trump hotel, miss universe pageants, the pee tapes, etc all the way through Lindsay Grahams repressed homosexuality, trips to moscow etc. 

Facebook was also used primarily by Prigozihns Internet Research Agency (I.R.A).  They went so far as to send young newly recruited Russian internet trolls on expenses paid tours around the U.S. so they could more effectively imitate mommy bloggers and 2nd amendment enthusiasts online to sway the 2016 election to the US candidate they had the most control over-  Trump.

The Russian mob/government planned on stealing the U.S. economy in an American version of perestroika.  I’m not sure it was a grand sinister plan as much as the result of systemic governmental corruption and ridiculous Silicon Valley valuations overlaid on commercial real estate speculation, but the results are the same. Too big to fail does not apply at this level of corruption.  The cancer simply overtakes the host and western democracy, then humanity dies. This closed loop eco-system of cancerous corruption is just a larger scale model of the gulags that preceded it. 

It just required altering the new online reality to keep people oblivious until it was done. It’s effectively the KGB’s soviet era surveillance state, Kompromat, intimidation and mind control from Putin’s formidable years in the KGB cross bred with the video game grand theft auto in the digital age. 



Ukraines “Jewish Nazis” as Putin likes to call them standing up to a bully destroyed the kleptocrats cover because they broke the code.

The CCP needed 2 things to be able to replace the USD with a programmable reserve currency of their own and destroy freedom of press and western democracy forever.  

Grain and  Microprocessors 

Putin promised Xi Ukraine in 3 days during the first week of the Olympics so that Xi would have the grain and supply chain lock (neon) to take Taiwan and TSMC without putting 400M of the poorest Chinese into famine.  

Now, 2 years into a 3 day war Russia desperately needed shahed drones and gave Iran the intel it then gave to Hamas for the Oct 7 attacks. 

The governments of Russia, China and Iran need their kleptocracy to stay dark  for their corrupt business models to survive. 

Trump, Netanyahu and MBS do as well.  The reason it’s all strange bedfellows is because sorting by nationality is their traditional tool to keep all of us fighting so they can hide their grift from the masses. 

Ignore nationality and religion.  Sort by psychopathy and net worth.  The results are exponentially more accurate.

Ukraine and Gaza are both genocides with a primary purpose of obfuscating mob corruption inside these government networks.

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically.

ArrowheadDZ,,,"The thing we’ve lost sight of is this:  the Federalist Society is profoundly well funded, highly organized, and has infiltrated every law school in the country.  It is virtually impossible for a law student to hold any leadership position or have a prestigious role like being the school’s law review editor without having the connections that accompany Society membership.

And in fact, people forget that in March and again in June, 2016, candidate Trump was trailing in the polls, and then made a public campaign promise to only appoint judges and justices recommended to him by the Federalist Society.  He literally promised to outsource the nominating process to the society, and nominate   whoever they told him to nominate.  His polling jump 3% when he first published his list of 21 possible SCOTUS candidates, and jumped again in June when he promised that he would always nominate whoever he was told and wouldn’t go “rogue” as other presidents had done.

Why do I recount all this here?  Because what we fail to realize is that the Federalist Society, despite its name and its elite, influential standing, is profoundly and deeply anti-democracy.  Their central tenet, their litmus test for judgeship, for campus leadership, for scholarships, is adherence to their president-as-serial-monarch philosophy.  They give it glossy names like unitary executive, but if you read the writings of proponents like Bill Barr or Alberto Gonzales, it becomes very clear that the President is the leader of the people, and not simply the head of the executive branch.

The Federalist Society was part of a well-funded long term war plan to wrest control of the government by going after the courts, rather than through electoral means, and they have succeeded.  They placed adherents in the vice presidency, two attorneys general, hundreds of state and federal judgeships, and what appears to be at least 5 but possibly 6 Justices.

We are completely distracted.  We worry about MAGA, we worry about the likes of Desantis and Abbott, we worry about the theocracy now in place in Louisiana and Oklahoma, and coming soon elsewhere.  But those battles are just that, planned distractions that take our eye of the serial monarchy, the “dictator lite” model that the Federalist Society promotes.  They have no transparency, no accountability, are unelected,and yet they represent the single most powerful voice in American governance, bar none.

Between the Federalist Society and Project 2025, we are facing a complete dismantling of the democracy experiment.  We’re just two years shy of the 250 year anniversary, and by all accounts it appears we couldn’t make it.

I won’t candy coat any of this.  If we don’t find a way to stop the Federalist Society and rid ourselves of the lethal cancer they represent, there’s no way out of this.  This is a stage 4 malignancy, it’s spread everywhere, and that was always the plan.  Their plan was always for the chains of authoritarianism to be too light to be felt, until they were too strong to be broken.

I don’t care who you are, or what story you’ve told yourself… if you are a member of, a supporter of, or sympathetic to the Federalist Society, no matter the reason, you are the single existential threat to democracy in America.  You either know it, or are deliberately turning a blind eye to it, but don’t lie and say you weren’t aware.

I don’t know what the right answer is.  We’re America, so rounding you up and putting you in indoctrination camps is pretty antithetical to our principles.  But I don’t see anyway that a liberal democracy has ever been able to break the authoritarian groundswells that have devours so many educated, industrialized, free nations.  The Democratic Party lacks the backbone to use the powers the courts are granting the executive, and so our government is a ratchet that can only move on one direction.  Nationalist authoritarian movements tighten the bolt when they have the wrench, and liberals just hold steady on the status quo, with no will to losses the bolt, undoing the damage of the previous tightening.

ExciteMeUp,,,"I’ll give you my experience with prednisone during my last 2 flare-ups, and some other experiences. 

I loved it at first. Was on 60mg a day for roughly a month, then dropped to 40mg, and began tapering off at 5mg each week for 2 months. 

I was naturally very skinny. 5’9, 135lbs. On prednisone I blew up to 175ish. Got moonface. I enjoyed the weight gain personally. It’s a lot of water weight and you will shed most of it. I stay around 155-160 now. 


The downsides… my vision went to shit. Now wear glasses. I’m not sure how big of a correlation my 2 flare-ups had with my vision going bad, but I did notice a degrade with it during and after my prednisone windows. 

Insomnia. It will be a pain getting to sleep during the first couple of weeks, but I adjusted. 

The worst part for me was the joint pain. It started about a month 1/2 on my first cycle. Absolutely terrible. I’d wake up with awful pain in every. single. joint. From fingertips down. My 2nd cycle I didn’t have it anywhere near as bad, but boy was the first awful. 

Appetite. Mine increased by about 300%. Example; would eat like 3 pieces of pizza from Dominos, to being able to eat an entire pizza + more in a sitting. I remember first seeing stretch marks around my cheeks/groin area and being like “wtf!”  So be ready to buy some fitting clothes if you gain a lot. 


I just had a colonoscopy last week, and everything was clear this go around. I’ve had 4 in the past 6-7 years. My last big flare up hospitalized me for a few days. Entire colon was covered. However, I was not on any preventatives at the time due to insurance issues. For the past year I’ve been on mesalamine (pill), but am swapping to Humira very soon as I just got better insurance that covers it.


Depending on how bad your case is (sometimes it seems like it’s worse than it is), your flareups won’t last long at all. You could stop bleeding/shitting 30x a day within a week on prednisone. I was diagnosed with IBS-D when I was around 15. It wasn’t until I had my first big flare at 30 they diagnosed me with UC. That was 8 years ago, and in the gap from then to now  I’ve had 1 major flare-up, and one small on that was starting up but I was able to tackle it quickly before it progressed. 


Diet wise, nothing I’ve found that I consume has caused any flare-ups. I eat whatever I want. I eat tons of spicy foods too. What I’ve noticed will throw me into a flare-up, is taking a shitload of ibuprofen for a week or two straight. I had some dental issues where I was taking 800mg x2 daily for about 2 weeks. Noticed some blood in the stool and immediately got ahold of my GI. Did stool and other lab work and started a 30mg prednisone routine and culled it before it took off. I was warned beforehand about NSAIDs & UC, but it was what I had at the time to deal with dental pain. 

Also, stress. I believe that attributed to my major flare-up a couple of years ago, and have been told/read it can be a factor. Try to do what you can to manage it. 

Try not to dwell too much on it. It absolutely sucks right now, and you’re going to overthink a lot of it (before I was diagnosed I got myself worried I had colon cancer). It’s super manageable though, and this could be the only flare you ever get. I know it sucks running to the bathroom so many times a day so your butt can sneeze out some blood & mucus, but the steroids will help. 


Talk to your doctor about preventatives. Here in the US we’ve got a few options.

I did have COVID in February and took a 5 Day course of Paxlovid I'm hoping this is nothing more than a previous reaction to COVID or Paxlovid or a reaction to the pep. I finished the course on May 11th and as of now the lymph node is still swollen and still very moveable.",0,1719849201,,,0,lb55e9e,t3_1dsj1iv,t3_1dsj1iv,1719849218,1,False,pep,t5_36pyq

During the pandemic my back went out, couldnt feel from the waste down, had an emergency Laminectomy. When I woke up from surgery, the nurses kept asking me if had trouble urinating, to which I replied, ""no"" but it kept getting asked. So the neurosurgeon that did the back surgery shows up and discussed what she saw, follow up care, and that she found a mass in my lower abdomen.  It ended up being cancer.  About 3 hours later, I was told I had covid as well. 10 months later, 9 rounds of kemo, a very long surgery at mayo clinic 13 lymphnodes removed, a tumor remove, and one mega dose of kemo for a week and Im cancer free. Short story long, had to give up a little bit of me to survive but Im here. Some days Im not sure I like what I have left of my life. I sure dont understand why Im here and others aren't. More questions  than I have answers to. Bills coming from every direction.  What I can say is Ive never felt so close to the bottom of the food chain. Its been 3.5 years cancer free, I wake up each morning, wondering what kind day itll be. Either i dont care, or am so used to being shit on by life that at the point where i say bring it. I aint dead yet you had a chance to kill me and Im here and you're not. I have no clue what Im doing in life, whatever direction I had going, gone.  Motivation, none, absolutely none. I could see my lifes contribution to the human race as 0. All that said, I get up every morning, go to work, mow my lawn, do my laundry, have more shit on my plate than I ever have, with less and less abilitty to handle it as each new day comes.  Somewhere inside me  I know it could be worse. My shit life and I know it could be worse, I know there is an ending coming , its coming for all of us. Dont know when, dont know where, In fact what I do know would fit in a shoe box,  what I dont know could fill this infinite world of ours. Point is, get up, get dressed and go start living a life you want to live. Go to a mirror,  look at it, if you dont make that person happy, no one else will either, and you wont make anyone happy either. Be honest, have personal accountability, you are the only person that can make those changes in your life, and go fucking do it. I've seen some crazy shit in my life, it can always be worse, which means it can always be better too!

>Sverige har självbilden av att vara ett tryggt land. Men så är det inte längre. Vi ser hänsynslösa dödsskjutningar, gängkriminella i välfärden, vidöppna portar för bedrägerier och storskalig ekonomisk brottslighet, dödsfall och allvarliga olyckor på jobbet.

>Det Sverige en gång var är vi inte längre. Det har blivit så på grund av politiska beslut. Genomdrivna av regeringar av olika färg. Yrvaket famlar nu politiker runt och försöker ställa vissa saker tillrätta. Men samtidigt vill högern göra Sverige än mer otryggt. 

>Förslag på försämringar i a-kassan och sjukförsäkringen har lagts fram. Försäkrings­system där löntagare avstått löneökningar för att få trygghet vid sjukdom och arbetslöshet

>Sjukförsäkringsutredningen lämnade nyligen sina förslag om hur en dålig sjukförsäkring kan göras ännu sämre. När remisstiden nu är slut riktar LO tillsammans med många andra hård kritik mot förslagen.

>Blir utredningens förslag verklighet kommer vi tillbaka till tiden när sjuka tvingades söka låtsasjobb och cancersjuka blev helt utan ersättning från sjukförsäkringen. Social­försäkrings­minister Anna Tenje (M) tog emot förslagen utan att blinka eller markera politiskt.

>LO varnade för just dessa försämringar i valrörelsen 2022. Upprört vände sig då en kränkt borgerlighet mot oss, sa att vi ljög, överskred gränser och sänkte nivån i debatten. Nu ligger förslagen på regeringens bord.

>Den vi sa inför valet 2022 har nu visat sig vara politik som regeringen är beredd att lägga fram. Försämringarna som sjukförsäkrings­utredningen föreslagit innebär att:

>Sjukas jobbförmåga ska efter 180 sjukdagar bedömas mot jobb som inte finns. Är du exempelvis sjukskriven för fysiska besvär, och har ett fysiskt krävande arbete, får du indragen sjukpenning om det bedöms att du kan ta ett påhittat arbete där du sitter ned.

>Sjuka i rehabilitering får indragen sjukpenning om läkaren inte kan säga exakt vilket datum personen är helt tillbaka.

>En deltidssjukskriven som arbetar oregelbundna tider, måste dela varje arbetspass exakt lika mycket. En halvtids­sjukskriven busschaufför måste helt enkelt hoppa av bussen efter fyra timmar. Varje dag.
Sjukskrivna behovsanställda kommer ses som arbetslösa efter två veckor, i stället för dagens 90 dagar.

>Sjuka som är nära pension hänvisas till en lång omställning till ett annat arbete eller tvingas att ta ut sin ålderspension i förtid, och får då en lägre ålderspension livet ut.

>Utredningen öppnar också för att en bortre tidsgräns för sjukpenning återinförs. Det här är det som kallats stupstocken, där allvarligt sjuka kastas ut i fattigdom.

PaedsRants,,,"Paeds here! Unfortunately this all depends on age + pathology/specialty + local pathways, so I can't really give a generic answer for you, but if you are a permanent/regular member of staff and not a locum GP doing a shift somewhere new then you should really be making the effort to get to know the pathways in your area (or know where to find them). I'm sure you can appreciate how frustrating it is for a busy paeds reg to be getting GP calls about e.g. a 13yo with ?SUFE, when they know that should be a direct referral to ortho with no paeds input required.


For the record, I do not know of a single pathway that requires you as the referring GP to discuss the patient with 2 separate teams, so if an ortho/gen surg is asking you to do that after they've accepted the patient, you can and should push back on this. If their protocol demands a paeds review for every child with abdo pain under 12 or whatever, that is for them to sort out, NOT you as the referring GP.


If in doubt + worried + busy++, by all means send them to ED with a letter and let ED figure it out, but that is very suboptimal for obvious reasons.


A few broad principles to consider (and definitely don't take as gospel and do check how it's done locally):


- the younger they are, the more likely it is you need to refer to paeds first rather than to specialty directly. Anything over 6 is not that young, and *probably* doesn't need to see paeds first. Anything over 12 is basically small adult territory, and almost certainly doesn't need to see paeds first.


- is your local hospital a tertiary or DGH? If it's tertiary, there is generally more scope to refer direct to specialty, e.g. discuss your ?quinsy directly with the paeds ENT team. If it's remote DGH, then probably should run it by the local paeds reg first.


- how ""acutely unwell"" are they? If it's an infective pathology with risk of sepsis, or there's cancer high on the differential, it's more likely they need to see paeds first. But again, if it's barndoor surgical like an abscess or septic joint, you can usually refer directly to the surgical specialty and let them bleep paeds as necessary.


- gen surg/paeds surg: there is often an age cutoff for appendicitis, e.g. above 12 the adult gen surgeons at the DGH will see, below 12 they need to see paeds first, who will refer to paeds surg as necessary. Likewise, for paediatric-specific pathology like pyloric stenosis, refer to paeds first.


- ENT: probably the most pathology-specific and variable as per local pathways. If it's really a barndoor ENT pathology that's likely to need surgical intervention (thinking textbook quinsy or mastoiditis), then I would strongly encourage you to refer to ENT directly, even at a DGH - but pathways vary.


In summary, you just have to learn what the pathways are locally, which will come with time and experience.",0,1719849816,,,0,lb579b1,t3_1dspn56,t3_1dspn56,1719849831,5,False,GPUK,t5_8aw5or

* **DDT:** The widespread use of the pesticide DDT led to the near extinction of several bird species, including the bald eagle, due to its harmful effects on reproduction.

* **Open Dumping:** Before regulations, municipalities and industries often dumped solid waste in open landfills, causing severe land and water pollution.

AMCreative,,SAG-AFTRA | TV/Film,"Couldn’t disagree harder. Let’s dissect.

“Look at all of these people who never took a class”

This is a logical fallacy called “Survivor Bias”. Other examples are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never having gone to college.

“I have taken 5 classes and only 1 was decent”

This is a statistical error centered around sample size.

If I told you I had a medication that cured cancer because 5 people took it and 1 went into remission would you trust that pill?

“I could have learned all of these things on my own”

And you should. IMO classes and self-motivated learning are independent tracks. One augments the fruits of the other.

“Long time students with the teacher have no credits”

And? 95% of actors don’t make a living acting. That’s the likelihood of you pulling any actor out of the wind and checking their credits, not just long term actors with a coach.

Further, and you should know this as a business major, acting classes rarely teach explicitly acting business strategy and entrepreneurship. So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren’t regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students… don’t do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher’s fault?

“I’ve had acting coaches tell me I’d never book a co Star then I did”

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

“Coaches don’t want people to be successful because they won’t study anymore”

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You’re not even thinking your arguments through now.

“I’ve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique”

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it’s something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it’s on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

—-

It feels like you’re treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don’t see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it’s always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I’m at the point where, generally, I don’t learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

So I was trying to be vague but our child has Rhabdomyosarcoma (bladder cancer). 

It's important because what little time we have we chose to spend with them playing DND, our family decided to treat us like shit for reasons we don't know. It's important because even with all that we showed up prepared, happy, smiling, inclusive, and trying to not make our problems ruin anyone else's game night. 

  
We have other kids to take care of and finding child care to go play a game on a consistent schedule is almost impossible for us. The time we have free we spend with him and our other kids, so yea, we'd love to find another group but finding a new play group is hard, it's really hard for us. 

Do you think we haven't been depressed during this? We aren't ignorant or being insensitive but only an asshole makes it everyone else's burden. Only a selfish person makes everything about them. 

They haven't called any of us for months to check on us see if we're doing okay, they haven't been here for us when we've asked them for anything.   
Every time we see them she has to say something is making her sad, something bad happened to her. Yea people can be sad, and talk about being sad and I honestly didn't realize what she was doing for a long time.  So the comment she made about ""no one at work said anything to me about my work anniversary"" looking at me pouting, but her eye's were just empty and it was so stupid, so self obsessed. So her first decision is to try and make us feel bad for her, like every time, this time what she said was so stupid it felt like i was looking at a pyscho and not my sister. It gave me clarity that she doesn't feel empathy anymore. 

She went to far with her bullshit and we realized she's been fucking with us. It was unhinged.

I’m going to paste a response I made to someone else because I think it would apply to you, and I’ll also add that nipples can shrivel up at even very slight stimulation so unless it looked so weird to the point where your breast looks dented or something I wouldn’t worry much about the shriveling. Here’s what I had said previously to someone:

I’m so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I’ve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery— they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn’t see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She’s not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it’s something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it’s really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day. You don’t mess around with this shit, and if your doctor seems to not be taking you seriously, find a new one.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/MT7GZOtAgd)  **March 30, 2024** 

I am a published author, I mean I am no James Patterson, Stephen King etc and really it's not the purpose of me writing but I make fun money off my book sales. In a given month I am in the green by $100-300 dollars on a new book depending on the book genre and season when first published. I don't really even do it for the money, like I said. I have a fulltime job and do plenty of other gigs as a performer slash artist on the side because it makes me happy. Artistic expression just makes my world brighter and helps me from falling into bad mental health cycles as I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD, or what I like to call, the Holy Bullsh*ttery, blessed be it's name. 

I started writing as a kid because I am dyslexic - highly - like ever see a person when you spell a weirdly spelt word and they look like they want to jump into oncoming traffic? I'm worse. Don't give me verbal directions FFS text it. Point. Anything. The second my mental word is required to need to know too many words at any given time, I panic. I have tried every class, app, TikTok lifehack...its not my strength. I am good at other things like coding or planning events etc. I have other strengths. So I just do my best and keep swimming like a dyslexic Dory. 

THAT SAID I was teased and bullied relentlessly all through childhood a lot growing up and labeled the dunce so the trauma lives. 

For an example, I was in my local paper - small town - for an event at school. I was like 2nd grade at the oldest. I made a whole imaginary town out of recycled materials and and had a story with it as my end of year project. I worked on it for literal months, even figuring out how to make it foldable so it easier to travel with it in my grandfathers minivan. My story had 10 chapters and was handwritten in my messy kid handwriting. I had a teacher Ms. Smith. That's her real name because F that woman and it's common enough. She said my project was low class but ""I guess I shouldn't expect much from you"" and she walked off. Her son, my classmate, stomped my project to oblivion. He smashed my playdough figurines of the people and pets, and as if that was not enough, he pointed and laughed at me when I cried. He then put copies of the article with my picture but added a dunce had and laughing faces in the school - lunchroom, homeroom, etc. I mean the guy could cure cancer if he used that determination on it, I will give him that. If you're reading this Tyler - F you in particular and may your socks always be just a *little* damp. 

I was unlucky enough that when I moved, Tylers mom happen to as well, so guess who had the privilege of that gem's company for 3 grades? Tyler shoved me lockers in the 4th grade. He called me dumb every day. In 5th grade I was called dumb and fat (I was an underweight child). 

So fast forward and I am now in my early 30s, still dyslexic as hell. I live in a different state. I have a life and learned ways to deal with my weird brain and function. I moved on from childhood trauma, therapy, etc etc... 

There is a guy I liked, Brian, and Brian seemed to like me too so we decided to do ""non-date causal hangouts"" to see if we vibe enough to consider dating (his words and idea). We hung out one on one for several instances but once he was super late so I had my laptop out. He saw me when he arrived and asked what I was doing and I sheepishly responded I was working on my next book. He inquired more and I told him I published my first when I was 17 and have published at least 1 every year since then and told him of Ms. Smith and Tyler and more horror stories I won't get into as this is now a novel itself lol but that it spurred me to prove them wrong and beat this weird stereotype that neurodivergent folk are dumb, etc. He asked to read it, and I said no. I use a pen name on purpose as those Amazon reviews can make you want to yeet your own soul from your body so I keep it separate from everyday life. 

Well, turns out if you know me and my nerdy joys, my pen name is easy to guess. From there its easy to *find* because I mentioned Amazon and let's just say my bio makes it pretty clear. At our next meetup he asked me if I was said author and my shocked Pikachu face told him everything so he started reading the series. He came back the next time we met to laugh and say ""I see why you don't put your name on your works. Don't quit your day job. Your writing sucks."" and he placed a copy of one of my books down on the bar. 

I couldn't help but drop my shoulders. He was laughing and talking, not seeing my expression and kept saying how he wasted hours of his life and FFS someone take my laptop as it might be a lethal weapon meant to kill us all with boredom. 

Turns out he's not into mysteries or fantasy. I said that maybe it's just not his genre and he said it wasn't but ""an [R-word] 3rd grader could have done better"" and it's a good thing I am good at my job. It was then that I could see he actually took in my expression and he backtracked. ""I mean you clearly don't do it for money so it's whatever right? "" and said I have other strengths but he did not believe at all that I make money off this. He asserting surely, I buy my good reviews and probably bulk buy my own books to improve sales. I don't do any of that. 

I just smiled it away and said ""well, I can't please everyone but I did make 250 this month from the sales of my last book alone so some people must like it"" and laughed it off. But I knew then and there I didn't want to pursue him anymore. When he texted to see if I planned our next hang out, I was honest and texted back that I wasn't interested and said that while I can take a note or any criticism, the way he went about it was hurtful and I don't want to be with someone who treats me that way for a hobby, that we are different people but I would like to remain friends, as otherwise we get on well, but nothing more. 

He went off on me saying I picked the wrong time to lash out as he was having a bad day and now I've made it worse and that I am so rude and petty to be mad at honest criticism. He said that if I am so sensitive over honest opinions, good luck finding anyone who would want my dumb🍑 since looks are all I have with makeup and work and ""nothing between the ears"" 

I blocked him but we have a mutual friend group and almost all of them have been asking me what's going on and that I broke his heart. I was thinking *what*? *How*? They said he's been depressed and asking about me and figured out I blocked him on everything and wants to give me a birthday gift (my birthday party past last week and I didn't invite him). My friends are saying we are adults and this is immature.  I mean I am not a saint and I have toxic traits too, but I don't want to be with someone who criticizes me and my work that way and treats me like bantha poodoo. Am I crazy? Am I TAH? 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/1OrGaLGdUj)  **May 5, 2024** 

Hi - so for anyone who cares to know, Brian told all our friends that I rubbed my achievements in his face and called him an idiot (I never said anything like that). He told them also about my post so he found it somehow and started telling everyone that I am trying to slander him as ""girls can ruin a man's reputation by snapping her fingers"" and suggested my next move would be to say he assaulted me. 

Some of our friends came at me hard saying I was bullying him and trying to ruin his rep and all he did was asking a girl he liked out for drinks and that I need to apologize and just suck it up and go to drinks with him. They since have either outright not invited me out with the group or disinvited me to events and it was really hard to accept. 

I was realy confused, because he was the one who made fun of me and I wrestled with myself going over every talk again and again wondering if I inadvertently said or did something to upset him. It wasn't until I checked our text and message history that it occurred to me to send the screenshots as he called me a moron and then when I rejected him he called me fat, desperate, and stupid. And there were more such messages after he found my book series. So I took screenshots and sent it to my friends and they were shocked. 

Apparently according to Brian my outwardly ""sweet demeanor"" hides my judgemental and cruel side and that I strung him along anf called him a loser when I told him I wasn't interested in dating him. I even pettily went back before all of this and screenshot spme of his rude or mean texts he made. And I screenshot my actual rejection text and his response and sent that along as well. 

Now the tides have shifted and most of our friends think he was the AH and 2 of our friends are saying I am sending ""my choice"" of screenshots to make him out to be a villain and that they have seen the ""real"" screenshots of me bullying him. I asked them to produce such screenshots but they refused and said I wouldn't be worried about them if I was innocent as some sort of ""gotcha"". 

I feel really bad as I wanted to stay friendly but I can never look at him with any semblance of respect anymore. I am glad it's cleared up with my friends (sans the 2 holdouts but they are now also on the outs with the group) so things are looking back to normal. I have my first publishing party for my next book and everyone is invited but them. 

Weird way it all ended but oh well.

So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father’s situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister’s college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn’t have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn’t happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn’t respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she’s “poor” and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop “holding her tuition over her head”. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever “pay me back” nor have I ever “held it over her head”. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn’t realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she’s still young. She once again didn’t reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It’s a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn’t replying to my texts and I’m just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn’t from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

hyphenomicon,,,"I got it from my life. Over the course of two years, right after I was getting my life in good shape after cancer and becoming interesting to women, I was sexually harassed by a diversity hire who didn't do any work, falsely accused of breaking into a sorority girl's home as her way of retaliating for telling her I thought she was manipulative and I didn't trust her enough to go to her house (I still have no idea where it is or was), which included a literal fake crime scene and report to the police, and finally targeted by a psychopath who used feminism to get positions of power from which she could prey on others in cons and scams via a rumor campaign that cost me scholarships, employment positions, the esteem of someone I cared deeply for, tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly got me kicked out of school. I have a PTSD diagnosis from this and suffer from extremely bad hypervigilance related to social interaction as a result. I am terrified of other human beings now.


Feminists have used me for sex while feigning friendship, promised me honesty and help with my high-functioning autism while lying and manipulating me, spread untrue rumors alleging I'm schizophrenic after I trusted them with knowledge of my disability (definitely not, no symptoms, currently receiving mental health care and my provider has confirmed my reasoning and perceptions are sound), denied me the opportunity to speak in my own defense, gaslit me, offered help and withdrawn it, body shamed me about a million different times, emotionally abused me, told me I was dangerous for reporting attempts of others to hurt me, lied about my behavior in the pursuit of petty grudges, encouraged dangerous women to girlboss by destroying other people, punished me for reporting literal crimes, and discouraged friends from listening when I was suffering and desperately needed someone to talk to.


Feminist books are great. The PR is wonderful. Feminist people treat men like shit. The best of you are apathetic. The worst of you are vampires for whom the ability to hurt men is a perk. There is zero policing against abusive women who use the movement as a source of justifications for hurting others, you simply deny it ever happens instead.


Women who are dangerous people target those who are vulnerable who others will not believe or care about if they report wrongdoing. Actual feminism encourages women not to believe or care about men who report wrongdoing. If you want to help people, just help them, no need for the ideological baggage and the tug of war to attach positive sentiment to the ism.",0,1719813320,,,0,lb37xth,t3_1dsemho,t1_lb2wbly,1719813334,1,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844

Now it’s in general life, learning what superficial people are, learning that I’ve been manipulated, me not being able to trust people, people only wanting my body or like having me around because of my appearance.

My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, my sisters moved 2-7 hours away from home.

- Fielding, I pay attention to fundamentals. Drop step for a pop fly, can they track the ball (this one is huge so many girls will make it to HS level not knowing how to really catch a pop fly.), and not running with glove out. Staying down and working through ground balls, you don't have the luxury to sit back and wait for them to come to you. Always moving towards the ball, no plays off, you're either attacking the ball or covering a position or backing something up every play. I will notice if the left fielder doesn't move to back up a play on the infield.

- Batting, solid contact, ability to become a base runner and contribute (this can be done several ways)

- Attitude and effort are king. I can fix a swing, I can fix bad mechanics in the field, I can make her a better ball player then what she starts as. I can't fix a crappy attitude, unwillingness to listen or be coached, and I won't bring a cancerous personality to my team.

The sort of man, who'll put you in a hole financially with no remorse! A ""nice guy"", who only does the barest minimum around the house to complete a transaction for sex! Now he's using his ASD diagnosis as a deflective shield to excuse even more flagrantly disrespectful behavior, on purpose! When are you going to get angry on your own behalf and decide that you deserve better than to be treated like a single mother in a married household and a hole for him to fuck? Jesus, the vast majority of autistic people beat themselves up for the most minor social faux pas, and here this guy is, treating you not as a person he loves, but as a wife appliance, who isn't putting out enough for his liking. Are you kidding me? No diagnosis is going to excuse this man's actions. Stop trying to find excuses that removes his agency in what he's doing to you and own the fact that he's acting like this, because he can and likes it. He doesn't care about you. He cares about what you do for him. Your feelings, your boundaries, your agency and worth as a person comes second to whatever he wants, and he'll assert control in any way he can, to keep making you feeling small and guilty for not ""doing enough"" to please him. Don't fall for the bullshit coming out of his mouth, and look at his actions. Are you going to waste more time being treated like this, and join the statistic of married women dying younger than single women, while your husband joins the one of married men living longer than single ones? Why the fuck are you wasting your love on someone, who doesn't even give a fraction of that energy in return? Why would you fuck a man you're basically raising like a dependent? Quit burning yourself out for the sake of someone, who'll absolutely leave you, if you ever come down with burnout, cancer, or a crippling injury.

dedlobster,,,"I’m not sure that “everyone” goes to Great Danes. I would think dog breeds in the 70-100lb range would be a far more common choice. 

Have you ever tried to pick up a Great Dane? Do you know how much space they take up in a room? Have you had blood splattered all over your walls because their tail got too happy and was injured on a piece of furniture? My parents have had Great Danes and 0/10 no frickin’ way would I ever own such a giant and unwieldy breed. Nice dogs, but not designed for apartments or homes with many small rooms. Rotties can get just as heavy as a Dane but personally I’ve also always opted for smaller rotties - 85lbs and under - so I can lift them in their old age when they develop mobility issues and need help up stairs or into the car. Consider your ability to physically handle and move the dog if it becomes injured or ill when choosing a dog.

Rotties have shorter life spans as well, on average, not unlike Danes, but this is true for many large breeds. One of my rotties lived to 8 and another lived to 13 - both died of bone cancer - a common health issue in rottweilers. And 8 years or 20 years - dogs do not ever live long enough. Saying goodbye is heartbreaking at any age. 

For a first time dog owner a rottweiler could be fine or it could not be fine - depends on the dog. I’d advise adopting an adult rottweiler that has had training already so you don’t have to battle the puppy phase, which can be pretty harrowing (puppies are a huge pain regardless of breed).

Technically tried  to stab  me, shoot me and kill us both in her car before I refused to ever get in a vehicle with her again.  The if she couldn’t have me no one could. I got told that several times.

It was a sick twisted nightmare. I wanted off the damn ride from hell so  badly. Times I thought I was going to die on it, to never escape her.

She was using something intentionally to induce extreme breathing issues. Obviously inhaling something. She brought it on as quick as she went into bathroom and coming out not even a minute later it seemed. Barely making it to the front door as I was trying to walk out that same door and collapsing at my feet. This wasn’t a fake it. It was real and serious medical duress ….

It was a form of her using it to control me and get me to stay, get her help and be by her side instead of finally leaving like I was trying to do.  Because I was a good person and always tired to do the right thing. Don’t get me wrong I wasn’t and am not perfect. Nor a saint. 

When I found out she died. I looked into it. 

Wana take a guess how she died? Yup…. 

So apparently her affair partner wasn’t a knight in shining armor after all.

Shut  the door and left her… 

Obviously the info I info I found didn’t say that exactly. She was found near her front door the morning after allegedly suffering a serve asthma attack the evening before was what I found. She  a few days later.  

I will put money how it all really went down though…. She never had those “attacks” unless I was trying to leave her for good. Thats when she was not threatening to get me falsely arrested if I walked out the door. Which was more often than not. Same with trying to stab or shoot me. Shed immediately start hitting herself as soon as I got her disarmed and I went for the phone to call 911z she’d do the try it and let’s see who they believe. It’s your career you  loose if you get arrested she’d  say with a smirk.

I was proud of myself for always doing the right thing at that moment. Oh yeah the through crossed my mind multiple times. It would have been an escape from her and a lot less messier than a divorce. I knew she’d make any divorce hell and do her best to ruin me further (which she did). She was not a good person.  Told me she was going to have her cake and eat it too. When I confronted her about the cheating and telling her it was the final straw. We were done… All the other crap she promised to stop she was back to doing too. But she made it clear to me, this was going to be my life. Like it or not… She wasn’t stopping any of it ever. So all that played in my mind. Oh yeah, I knew it was the easy out. 

Side note. I think non stop and race through scenarios quickly. It’s natural for me  and I never learned how to shut it down until recently. Worked great for my career and the military… but it’s  also a curse at times. Lot of wasted and needless thoughts with all that what if bs…when it’s pointless..or I’d never do it anyways….’

That’s exactly how I escaped from her finally, but I put her on an ambulance and ran for my life literally (grabbed a go bag and ran)…. Let her play the victim and how dare I leave her. But damn it she was safe in medical staff hands and I was done being threatened be it my life or my career with a false arrest.  Done being with a cheater and someone who was intentionally trying to break me like a wild horse…I firmly believe she took pleasure in trying to break me. I suspect that’s what her mom did to her dad.

I look back and no regrets I did the right thing every time… I couldn’t live with having done that. 

If I had tried to tell the paramedics or hospital staff what she did. She would have found a way to blurt out the “he beats me” bullchit. Learned that lesson the hard way. And when they go into that mode not a damn one of them ever listened to what I was saying. Thankfully instead of calling 911’, I just got removed from  the hospital. One of local cops that showed up on scene for the ambulance  calls was definitely looking for a chance to jam up a man first chance she could  for a domestic battery legit or not… My ex would just smile when she showed up. Like see how close you are to losing everything.

When a doctor told me she never had  cancer (faked cancer and treatment to get me to stay at one point too) she was trying to get pain meds for her “cancer” pain.  Doc disappeared for 40 mins to an hour..  He came back pulled me aside and did the she never had cancer. He’s positive.  Then he dropped the munchowesen word. Then confronted her. She let out an evil vile screech, jumped on her phone. It wasn’t 20 minutes I swear it was so damn fast it was insane. She was being wheeled out by a private ambulance service and taken to another hospital.. I have never seen anything like that in my life!!!!!

No way that was the first time…. Why I say I’d love to talk with her ex fiancé and see all what he experienced too. She honed these skills on someone else before me. 

So I tried  to get the second hospital to call the first one and talk to the doctor. Soon as she found out, she did  “the he beats me” and I found myself being escorted out of the hospital and mother F’d.  Got a hold of the first doc and begged him to call. Yeah dude it’s safer for us to wash our hands. Can’t you put this is the notes you send over? No… Not our hot potato any more.  She’s not our problem and we are leaving this dead horse lay!!!!! Sorry you are sol….

Despite all that anger and hatred I did the right things to the best of my ability. Felt like I failed at times… That bothered me. I told her parents multiple times she needed help and that they needed  to help me get her help. They said they understood. But that help never came. But can’t risk mommies monster tells how she became the way she was.

Regardless of whether the vaccine is responsible for this mass (which it could be) it is something that needs to be resolved.  The good side of this issue is that tumors in kidneys are less likely to metastasize and spread all over the body…the prognosis is pretty good.

The studies are just coming out now with adverse side effects connected to mRNA injections.  The injections were stated by many to never leave the injection site.  

They did.
Spike proteins presented on cells throughout the entire body and continued to do so for over a year after the initial injection in pathology reports that are consistent.

Many studies are underway and not out yet.

headshot_g,,,"You screwed up, you wasted quite literally your best years to find a person doing absolutely none of that AND becoming overweight. For men who want serious relationships (meaning kids will be involved later) they are not looking to start with women already over 30. By the time you're together with them for a while, that theyre sure you're worth marrying and have enough capital in this economic clown world to make that happen... thats an extra 5? Something years added to the clock, sometimes longer. You'll be pushing 40.

If you added 5 years to a 20 year old it barely even registers. Even early 20s at 23 it puts them in a decent enough position to forge that family. Men you're after WONT be clubbing, WONT be on dating apps (which are cancer) they will either be at home doing their thing or outside doing their thing in meaningful hobbies/skill building endeavours. So you'll either meet them gaming or meet them actively engaging on sport/hiking/volunteering/at church etc. But they will be looking for women in an age bracket you arent in.

Your best bet imo, for a demographic that would still be in line with what you have and ""enough"" of what you want... would be chill whisky bars where working a conversation is key (females over 30, welcome to the male world where you have to have amazing verbal game or you get nowhere) or specific events related to something you're interested in (iunno, a space convention or woodworking convention or literally just SOMETHING) and just engage with people, be bright, be genuinely interested (dont fake this its so obvious). If you have literally nothing you're doing rn, find SOMETHING, ANYTHING, and start right freaking now, heck even collecting golf balls or some other odd hobby will still have men that will be acceptable to you. ""Being the table"" only works for 18 to 23 year olds and ONLY if they arent insufferable to be around.

And protip if nobodys ever told you this in your life, you're going to hear it right now. No man gives a flying fuck about your achievements, your degrees, your business, NONE of that. A man would be 100% more ok with dating a Hungry Jacks cashier that brightens his day and makes him feel amazing than a Masters degree, boss babe tech startup tycoon or anything like that. DO NOT project what women want in men to what men want in women, Im astounded by what so many women zive talked to think men are interested in and how is literally just what they look for in guys... truly it is not, we dont care if you're penniles from a 3rd world country, we only care if you improve our quality of life with your existence because we are PLENTY capable of functioning solo as thats a male default setting. Men have an extra probably 20 years on their timeline women dont have, thats just a biological fact we're born with, so us settling for a woman means she has to tick the boxes a family requires the woman to be. Does including you in that mans life improve it in any way? Is the mental cost-benefit of adding a gf to his life being outweighed by the bright energy, fun, thoughtfulness, skills, feminine energy etc. that girl can bring and is suited to? If you dont have an answer to this, this is why you cant keep a man around, work on being this and you will see results (or dont, its your life your choices, but dont blame me when guys ignore you).

Also ffs stop sleeping with your tinder dates, you're literally part of the problem. Why would men anywhere actually invest in women if women on tinder keep giving what they want from them with minimal short term effort? If every single woman on the planet KEPT THEIR LEGS SHUT until a certain standard is met, that standard would be met overnight. Ai can already hear the armies of fembots and redditards going ""but it shouldnt be on women to repress their sexuality"" or whatever else they come up with.... but it is. We dont have billions of *grapes every year from men just taking what they want when they want it from any woman in eyeshot. Women hold total control over access to p*ssy and thats just reality, so USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE as a filter.

So in short, GET SKILLS MEN CARE ABOUT which are not skills women care about in men (if you can homecook a fantastic meal from scratch you're 70% of the way there), up your verbal game because men at this stage of life will do literally anything else than have drole conversation, dont be insufferable to be around (or a feminist) and dont still be overweight as thats just a public advertisement that you lack the self-control, discipline and respect for yourself... let alone what it might mean for other people. 

All of these things are something you can achieve with purely effort and minimal to no money.

Jag fick ett ”konsultuppdrag” för några år sedan att ta mig igenom den vetenskapliga litteraturen på medicinska indikationer för cannabis. Spoiler; den är svag. Riktigt svag. 

Viss evidens för smärta men biverkningarna (att vara bäng) tolereras sämre än dåsigheten, illamåendet, förstoppningen av opiater. Man måste förstå att en medicinsk patient vill vara smärtfri och välfungerande. Att Agda med spridd cancer vill spendera sista tiden hög som ett hus och samtidigt vara med barn och barnbarn. Nej. Det verkar inte fungera som en smärtmedicin. Att Liam vill röka holk för sin stukade fot istället för att äta naproxen. Ja det är lättare att förstå. 

Viss evidens för muskelspänningar vid MS. Men samma sak här. Biverkningarna är för svåra för att anses vara fördelaktiga sett till övriga alternativ.

Absolut ingen indikation vid Parkinsons sjukdom. Ett fåtal case reports där personer har rapporterat subjektiv förbättring men ingen som påvisats hos större populationer. 

Jag adresserar inte ruseffekten, skadeverkan jämfört med alkohol eller samhällsekonomiska konsekvenser här utan endast det medicinska. På den punkten är det däremot ett rätt tydligt nej. Det finns ingen tydlig medicinsk indikation för cannabis. Inte på populationsbasis.

Street_Hedgehog_9595,RomanCatholic,Roman Catholic,"Lemme ask you this. If someone came along and said I'd give you 1,000,000 dollars to avoid this sin, what would you do differently? Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.

Particular507,,,"* I understand she doesn't know exactly what he's doing. But what she knows is that her mild-mannered husband is suddenly absent from their lives randomly for extended periods with vague explanations. He's acting completely out of character. She can tell he's lying, as you know she's right.
* You can't say it's unreasonable for her to be suspicious when her suspiciousness is completely justified by the fact that he IS lying to her. Whether or not she is certain of that doesn't really matter.

At that point she has no idea he cooks as stated, and everyone has right for his time alone from everybody, especially during cancer and insanely difficult situations in life, she's controlling from the beginning following and asking about every step he makes from episode 1. Controlling wife, hates her sister with mental problems, accuses Jr of doing drugs and tells him how to speak, screams on Hank when he visits because not all attention is towards her, harasses Jesse because of supposed weed her 50 year old husband with cancer is smoking(again like it's heroin) etc.

* Yea cus she wants a divorce lol. She wants a divorce and he refuses. ""I'm breaking up with you"" ""No you're not. And if you get with anyone else you're cheating."" Not sound logic

It is cheating technically since she's still married and does it by purpose to spite on him.

* The twins shot Hank because Gus forbade them from killing Walter and then told them they should kill Hank instead. Had Walter not been cooking meth, that wouldn't have happened.

Twins mistakenly thought that Walter killed Tuco which isn't the case, Gus told them the truth.

* Hank was there that day because he was using the lowjack in Jessie's car to track him. He was looking for Walt when he found Tuco. Which wouldn't have happened if Walt wasn't cooking meth.

Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly. Not to mention Hank wouldn't even be cured if Walter didn't pay treatment. But yeah what am I talking, Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

* What a hero, he saved them from a situation he put them in.

Welp he is in that situation, Hank crossed Gus a number of times and he threatened Walter that he would slaughter everyone if he tries to intervene, if he didn't, Hank would be as Jesse said, scalped same as Victor.

* Because she desperately needs it. Which she wouldn't, if Walt just took the job at Gray Matter.

So she needs that sweet sweet money she said she hates just a few days ago after telling Walter that if he goes she won't call police when he left? Her problem, make up your mind duh. Walter choose which job he will take and what he'll do with his life, it's his problem not hers if she doesn't care, but she does because MONEY!

* Walt literally poisons a child with lily of the valley to manipulate Jesse into helping him. Gus is a villain, so is Walt.

Again, same as the previous thing with killing Gus, it was lily of the valley(no deaths were confirmed from it) and not cyanide or ricin first and foremost, not cheering on it of course, but it was again to kill Gus and prevent the above mentioned stuff about Gus and his entire family from happening.

Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren’t just a moral good because they prevent disease; they’re a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they’re essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

   **Source**: Pinker, S. (2011). *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. Viking.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we’re talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation—traits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate’s last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren’t just about reducing cancer rates—they’re about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let’s face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it’s right to recycle or how to create a more just society.

He is acting out of character and being suspicious.  That's because he's committing crimes and attempting to conceal it.  She knows that because she knows him.  Someday when you have a serious relationship you'll understand.  He isn't just trying to have alone time, he's committing crimes.

Not controlling, just doesn't like being lied to.  Doesn't hate her sister, just doesn't like being gifted stolen property.  Would you be okay with that?

Nope, Marie thinks Jr is doing drugs.

They wouldn't have been trying to kill Hank if Walter didn't cook meth, end of story. 

> Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly.

Hank wouldn't have run into Tuco alone in the middle of the desert if he wasn't looking for Walter.  This is also a retarded, moot point.  He never would have been in that situation without Walter cooking meth.  

> Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

Hank wouldn't have been in the desert with Tuco without Walter's actions.  I'm objectively correct, it's his fault.

He is actively involving his family in his crimes.  Maybe if you have a family someday you'll understand.

Walter poisoned a child lol.  That's categorically villainous.  He didn't HAVE to do anything, he WANTED to be a criminal.  He had other choices he could have made that would have prevented everything.

pnam0204,,,"**THE ETERNAL HERO AND THE FINALITY**

“What nonsense are you spewing? A destructor don’t solve problems, I end both the troublemakers and the victims equally.”

The feminine boy in highschool girl uniform look up from his phone, he’s clearly annoyed at the intruder and their accusation. Part of him was also surprise that someone suddenly found him. But a quick glance at the soul and he already realize she’s an acquantaince. Much like himself, the Reincarnated Hero is also a constant variable throughout countless worlds. However, to retain past life’s memory and recognize him like this is still the first time occurence.

“I’ve seen through your facade. You’re not a heartless destroyer as you always claimed to be.”

Yurika the Infinite Reincarnator claim, this might be the first time she meet this boy in front of her in this life, but she had also met and fought side-by-side or clashed blade with countless other versions of him during her infinite lives

“You save helpless victims while saying you’ll end then when their ‘expiry date’ actually come. You slain corrupted gods because they reach ‘expiry date’. You cure cancer while calling it ‘killing the errors’. Yet your goodwills never extend to humanity as a whole. You can slay eldritch horrors from another dimensions yet refuse to lift a finger when wars break out”

“And why should I? Great power great responsibilities? Ridiculous! Just the excuses greedy humanity uses to exploit the goodwill of those with power. You think you ants can exploit me the same way?”

“I simply can’t understand you. After unlocking memories of all my previous lives, I recognize you in every of them. You have the power, you have the goodwills, yet you always chose to be a bystander even when humanity of that world was dying.”

Yurika has deduced from experience and past lives’ memories that the boy in front of her is not a regular mortal. He’s some kind of divine beings that’s also different than the gods she had seen. Not bound by worship, humanity or even the world. His Authority exceeds even that of whatever Chief God of any world despite being a foreign entity in their home turf. Yet he standby idly whenever apocalyptic events happened. And instead of helping the remaining human rebuild, he simply end the world itself.

“Simple, I have tried it countless time before. I have grown bored after every attempt end in failure.”

“How? You have the power to reshape reality. You can bend humans to you whims without none of us be the wiser.”

“Because of freewill and you human’s earthly desires. I gave human blessings to push back against demon, you human used it to oppress other races as the ‘divine chosen’. I gave you abundance of resource that can lead to post-scarcity utopia, you human somehow made poverty gap and resource war even worse. I gave you space travel to escape your dying planet and you used it to expand and conquer”

The feminine boy dejectedly dropped his phone and started slurping his hot cup noodle. Yurika knew full well he’s a divine being who can reshape reality with his thoughts, yet somehow he seems very… human. His expressions were not that of a “holier than thou” like other gods, he just seemed like a disappoint parents who gave up on their unruly children.

“Surely you can enforce rules and punishments to discipline humanity?”

“It’s only called discipline when parents do that to their child. But I am not your parents, nor do humanity see yourself as children. Therefore it’d be called dictatorship instead.”

“So you tried that too?”

“Yes.”

The boy snapped his finger, the room change into a scenary of another world. Events were happening in fast-foward like a video recording.

“I got rid of the evils in human hearts once, it led to a utopia of harmony where people can do no wrongs. You might not remember but you were there too, your first life before you were granted the ability to reincarnate. You broke free from the harmony, regained your individualism and rebeled. You declared good and evil must co-exist and it’s human nature to triump over their inner evil to do good. You considered the human with no capacity for evil at all is no different than machine programmed with the Three Laws. You said humanity’s fate should be in humanity’s hand, not decided by an almighty being”

Yurika silently watched as the climatic battle of her first self unfolded. Mortals vs gods. She was no match in battle but she won the debate. She successfully convinced the boy to return freewill to everyone.

Then it was chaos. She naively believed people who experienced thar utopia of goodness and harmony for so long would know better than to ruin it. But greed and selfishness quickly took over. Free health care system began to charge patients for money. Food distribution system fell apart. People were driven out of their own house because it’s no longer free. The Heroine herself tried to fix it, but then was framed and executed.

And then she was reincarnated. In each new life she always had the great desire to do good and help the world. Yet none of her lives were successful no matter how many times it happened. Sometimes her sacrifices were in vain, sometimes peace fell apart as soon she - the hero figure - passed away, sometimes she was betrayed “for the greater good”

Then Yurika realize something.

“Wait, so my reincarnation power was yours?”

“Yes. After the fight with you, I gave up on trying to save humanity, I lost my goodwill for them. But as you know, I can still have bias toward individuals, one of which is you. I let you reincarnate endlessly so you can carry on my old goodwill for humanity.”

Yurika was speechless. She was tired of her constant previous failures, so she seek out the familiar feminine boy to ask for his direct help. She never expect the truth to be like this.
The reason she is here asking for divine intervention to saving humanity was because of herself rejected it in the far distance past.

EXSPFXDOG,,,"I have been on every pain medicine they have,  and the only thing that worked for my pain was methadone. I had a situation where my doctor got tired of having the government looking over his shoulder he just retired! It is getting harder and harder to find pain clinics that will take you anymore, so if you find one, only do things by the book!

My doctor drug tests me every visit, and if you are smoking pot or taking any pain drug he didn't prescribe, he will bounce you out the door
I have seen him kick them out the door! 

I had a situation where I had pain meds for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but nothing for bedtime, so I couldn't sleep at night from the pain! I took methadone for my main pain med and hydrocodone for breakthrough pain. I had to give up the hydrocodone to get two more methadone to take at night! It gave me my life back! I could sleep again!

The government is like a 10,000-pound gorilla, and the amount of pressure they put on pain management doctors is almost unbearable! When they get the feds come in, they take all of their patient records!

That leaves doctors without the ability to know their patients' medicine, dosage, history, etc!

 Most pain patients are not trying to get some kind of buzz or knock themselves out they just want to stop hurting so they can smile every so often and enjoy life again!

It is the people who take handfulls of pain pills to get high that have messed this up for people who need their medicine to live! Oxycontin was made for people who have cancer, and it is timed release, so they don't have to take medicine every 4 hours 24/7!

 The people who take it to get some kind of buzz defeat the timed release built into oxycontin so they get hours' worth of medicine all at once and can overdose and kill themselves! 

It is very dangerous, and they are hurting the cancer patients and chronic pain patients that need these medicines!

In my opinion, it is not a NC law issue, it is a federal law issue. When the politicians make changes in law, they go way overboard. They were seeing overdose deaths going up, and they felt they had to do something, but they don't do anything halfway and don't really consider the people who will be hurt by their new laws and regulations!

Nazon6,,,">Nope, I said comparing the human drive and ability in sexual intercourse to a nuclear reactor technician is fucking dumb.

And again, I pointed out that you're misunderstanding my point because you don't know what an analogy is. It's not about the OBJECTS in the analogy, it's about the PRINCIPLE. Im not sure if english is your first language or not (which I don't mean in any offense, I just mean it for the sake of the argument), but let me illustrate it for you:

1. A full grown adult tells a young child that it's okay for them to have sex. The child is naive and is relying on the adult to be telling the truth. The adult ends up sexually abusing them because the child doesn't know any better, thus, trauma develops in the child. Note that not every experience will be like this.
2. An experience nuclear reactor technician tells an average citizen that knows nothing of a nuclear reactor that it's okay for them to operate the machine. The citizen is naive and is relying on the technician to be telling the truth. The citizen ends up leaking radioactive material into their enclosed operating room, thus, cancer develops in the citizen. Note that not every experience will be like this.

See the similarities? Again, I'm not comparing a technician to a predator, but the principles for why both circumstances are wrong is the same.

Constantly. Since the age of 14, when I started having some tiny symptoms. I was 90 pounds then. I started having horrible migraines, because my heart was working literally overtime. Doctors were stumped. My father didn’t believe me and thought I was faking my symptoms. 

I dealt with the symptoms until I was 26, when I went to the hospital for the 3rd time in less than a week, because I thought I was both having a heart attack and a brain aneurysm at the same time. I was about 110 pounds when wet. While they tried to diagnose me, I actually started to have a heart attack, since my heart rate was 180-200. I was put into a medical coma, they saved my life by causing a pseudo aneurysm in my leg, and putting a ballon pump in my heart. 

I was in that coma for 3 months. They finally found out what was really causing my issues. Cancer! Well two kinds, actually. I had cancerous cells on my thyroid gland, but it was not the only cause, I also had something called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. It caused a tumor, called a pheochromocytoma, to grow on my adrenal gland, and that was the underlying problem. 

Long story short, I was very lucky and had an amazing team of endocrinologists at UCSF. They removed my thyroid, some lymph nodes, and the phyo, and took that adrenal gland with it. I’ve since recovered and am in remission. It could rear its head again, but for now I’m ok. I still only weight 130, but I am slowly gaining weight. I struggle with appetite.

We bought a new enclosure and got husbandry all up to speed. Her first vet visit was “okay” though we weren’t thrilled with the vet necessarily. She said back leg bones felt a little soft and gave us liquid calcium for daily use. Toward the end of April I noticed her pulling her ribs in every now and then like labored breathing. Took her back to same vet for possible URI. Found fluid in abdominal cavity. Said could be from heart or liver issues, possibly cancer. Offered to euthanize right then and there. Didn’t really talk about diagnostics or treatment. 
We decided to get a second opinion and the next day my husband and I both took off work, started driving, prepared to go the 90 minutes for an exotics only clinic south of San Francisco. But I was also making calls as we were driving and we found another exotics a little closer to home who could do an urgent appt. She said similar things to first vet (including euthanasia option), mentioned a possible tumor in abdomen. She also said we could do bloodwork and x-rays. This was a Friday afternoon and the results were back Monday. Bloodwork was “surprisingly normal,” no signs of infection, normal blood sugar, etc. but x-rays showed several opaque oval structures, possible egg follicles. Did ultrasound the next day and confirmed female & egg bound. Had surgery two days later where they removed 25-30 egg follicles. Came home with antibiotics. Surgery was May 3rd and recovery has been gradual. At the time she also had some pretty bad sores on her tongue that both vets weren’t really sure of the cause so even though she was interested bugs she was having trouble getting them to stick. We were giving  critical care for the first 2-3 weeks post op. So, probably a longer answer than you were expecting… but her appetite is slowly returning. I suppose it’s possible she may have other issues that aren’t clear but she’s eating and drinking and pooping. Loves her time outside in our backyard. Super tolerant of being held.

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‘should’ be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn’t a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don’t believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don’t know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I’ll restate that you’re correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can’t chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don’t do those sorts of  things.

It's sometimes in the small details.  Driving from northern New Hampshire back to South Dakota and just noticing how oddly expensive supplies are along the way.

How did buying one meal at Wendy's and splitting it just cost me $20?  Why isn't anything in the motel room working properly?""  Those are the boring details.

The more interesting small details that just feel a little ""off"", like the old world was traded out for a new and slightly shittier model while we were all knocked unconscious are things like, ""why does this small town in Pennsylvania look totally abandoned?  None of the houses have lights on.  Somehow it's darker than rural South Dakota out here.  There's no signs of life anywhere... oh shit, this town lost about half its population after 2020.  We're basically driving through a ghost town.""  It's meeting up with my business partner who just spent the week in New York City instead of driving across the country like I did and hearing about how all of his normally successful friends can't find work-- and neither could he.  How he saw one of my close friends that I met while working on TV and film in the Before Times, and how she couldn't find a job either-- the film sets are closed.  It's the moment when he showed her pictures of ""Out of Lockstep"" and she teared up-- even though it was pictures of the funny part and she was very pro-mandate in 2021.  The really strange details are things like hearing from my dad about how he tracks the crime rates in Rochester NY like they're the weather report now-- he needs to know how bad it is before deciding to go out for the day.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.

In 2022, The LNP still won the popular vote in pretty much every state and Territory despite Morrison's severe unpopularity at that point. They still only lost due to Labor having enough no. 1 preferences which they simply won't have nearly as many come 2025, and other people preferencing Labor higher than the LNP, which again Labor won't get nearly as many. 

Dutton also has pretty much all the media on his side, plus any media that's pro Greens because they're also against Labor which only helps Dutton and the LNP. So he's getting little if not zero push back on his insanely idiotic Nuclear Energy scheme, in fact you had ""journalists"" telling Albo he should be praising Dutton for his Nuclear policy after questioning why Albo and the Labor party are against it. That's the state of journalism in our country. It's all batting for one side and nothing is stopping them from doing so. 

Labor could cure all known cancer and the media would call them out on why people are still breaking their bones or getting the flu. Meanwhile the LNP could start mass murdering everyone and the media would praise them for helping with overpopulation. 

I'm worried that Dutton will win the next election through no fault of the Albanese Labor Government, but through pure media manipulation. Dutton has brought nothing good to the table and the only thing he's being hard on is his Nuclear Policy. Even if you're for that his Nuclear Policy, do you really want Dutton and the LNP to be at the forefront of Nuclear Power in this country? I'd say no, you wouldn't be for that at all. 

Remember to preference Liberals and the LNP last, as well as their sister parties like One Nation and UAP. They aren't for you, they're for their donors and shareholders. That's it. If you don't want to preference Labor first, at least have them above those other three.",0,1719807190,,,0,lb2xa1c,t3_1drykf1,t3_1drykf1,1719807205,3,False,friendlyjordies,t5_321dg
ChampionshipOnly4479,,,"> Just because someone claims they have a disability doesn’t make it true. 

So what? How’s that relevant? When someone tells you he has mental health problems, cancer, symptoms of a heart attack or whatever, your response isn’t “oh, but maybe that’s not true, why should I believe you, nah”

> And even when it is true, there is no world in which any person must submit to feeling unsafe to “accommodate” the person making intrusive demands. While the concept of “reasonable accommodations” is fuzzy, anything that requires another person to submit to violation of their boundaries is by definition unreasonable. 

The way I was raised, we watch out and help the people around us. Especially friends and friends of friends but even strangers. 

When an old lady falls down on the street I help her up and call an ambulance if needed, I don’t tell her she may be faking it to steal my wallet and that she doesn’t have a right for help anyway. 

And if someone in our group gets sick and asks to be taken to a hospital I don’t tell him to take care of his own shit because he’s responsible for himself and doesn’t have a right to be taken to a hospital and that there’s a risk of him faking it for whatever malicious motive I can construct. 

And when my friend tells me his anxiety disorder doesn’t allow him to do this or that then we will happily find other activities rather then telling him that he’s just faking it to have it his way and that we don’t have to “submit to violation of our boundaries”.

Once I make myself part of a group, whether that’s just a trip with friends and friends of friends or our society as a whole, I accept a moral and ethical responsibility for the people around me (and I’m glad that my home country actually makes it a legal responsibility to help). Otherwise I simply shouldn’t be there in the first place.

And should I ever be in a situation where I need the help or support or compassion of those around me,  I hope they’ll grant me the same treatment. 

But I have to accept that no everyone thinks like this and that you’re one of those people. That’s just how this world is.",0,1719807252,,,0,lb2xec1,t3_1drsy7d,t1_lb2sfhj,1719807269,-1,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq
PatientNobody9503,,,"Thank you for your insight. I am an introvert, but I can be an extrovert too at times if I'm comfortable enough in a situation. I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

The only reason I want to find other converts is because they have seen a lot of what I have seen likely growing up in the Western world and not being born muslim. While born muslims also have a lot of troubles growing up I just feel like its a bit different in experience, you know?",0,1719807628,,,0,lb2y41v,t3_1dsf8if,t1_lb2s3ow,1719807644,2,False,islam,t5_2qhbp
BlackbirdNamedJude,,,"I used to take a muscle relaxer and my pain meds three times a day, use a TENS machine and lidocaine patches on the regular and some days could still barely function.  Waking up was the worst because I was in pain the second I opened my eyes and that first movement in the morning was something I feared. 

When I was on biologics I only used muscle relaxers and pain meds on days I work, although I occasionally maybe need a muscle relaxer on days off where I was doing a lot of activity.  I could fall asleep easier and wake up and just go.  I was back in the gym and weight-lifting and getting stronger than I had been in years...in fact my leg press was higher than it had been before my back issues really started up!  Honestly the biggest thing was I so rarely needed my cane that I would forget it at home so often. 

I am currently fighting my new insurance to cover my biologic and it's a struggle.  There are some days I get off work, and even with the pills I've taken I'm at a 8-9 on the pain scale....and I'm using my cane more often and saving up to get a rollator just in case this battle goes on much longer.

I understand the risks, and every 6 months I get a TB test and my blood tested for things like WBC.  I wear a mask when I am in public and make sure to sanitize my hands often just to cut back on potential issues. 

This is a very personal thing but the risks of biologics do not worry me as I accepted my fate of getting cancer (really bad family history...and I do mean really bad) when I was like 11.

This post's original body text:  

I have been living in my Lola’s house since I was 5 years old. She took care of me since yung parents ko nasa City kami nasa probinsiya. 

Lahat ng anak niya except kay papa naiwan dito sa bahay para may kasama siya. Bills are divided here. Electricity kanya while sa akin ang water and groceries weekly. My rent for space siya na sina papa ang nag mamanage. Though pinapangalan niya kay papa ang Business Permit sa kanya parin ang bayad ng renta. Si mama may maliit na carenderia.

Recently nagkasakit siya. Doctor said may bukol siya sa tyan which can lead to cancer daw. Di na pwede biopsy due to her age and maintenance na lang na gamot. 

She was suppose to go to Singapore kasama yung isang 2 na kapatid ni papa for vacation. Pero dahil nag kasakit siya at na confine ng matagal sa hospital na cancel. Yung mga kapatid ni papa nagalit because all has been paid na daw.

I know this post is turning into a rant but para lang clear ang picture. Hospital from our probinsiya is 1 hour away. The 2 siblings ayaw mag bantay. Ang isa US nurse that doesn’t like the hospital because “its pangit daw” not like sa “Yu esss”. Yung isa was busy partying and drinking because dumating yung college best friend niya from abroad.

Ang nag bantay kay lola is yung tita ko na asawa ng isa pang kapatid ni papa (hindi yung 2 na pupunta sana sa SG) since siya lang ang available. Di pwede sina mama at papa kasi may baby na ako and baka may madala silang sakit but everyday they drive papunta sa hospital. Mag dadala ng pagkain or kung ano kailangan. 

Nung nalabas na si lola sa hospital they decided without our knowledge na ilipat si lola doon sa bahay ng tita ko na nag bantay. Because ang sabi nung isa na “US NARS” napabayaan daw namin si lola. Agree naman yung lasingero. 

US nars spent most of her time here sa PH na nililibre friends niya from Highschool instead of spending time with my lola. Even used lola to pay for her hotels and expenses. The lasingero only visits to ask money.

Pasensya po if sobrang haba na.

Tanong ko po is if mawawala na po si lola and they decide to sell her house pero di pumayag si papa can they still sell it? Ang tittle is I believe naka pangalan pa sa mother in law ng lola ko. 

May bahay naman po kami pero naiwan kami kay lola para may kasama siya since ang totoo sila ang naging pabaya. Ayaw nila na ibalik si lola dito sa bahay.

If they sell the house wala naman kami magagawa. Akin lang yung memories na dito ako lumaki kasama si lola.

While Trump spends his time so far up Putin's ass his breath smells like spray tan oil - Biden's administration is working daily to help folks everywhere. 

I see new infrastructure builds from Biden's Build Back Better funds everywhere I go. Trump couldn't get an infrastructure bill passed. 

New generic drugs that are a tremendous boon to me and others with ADHD are going to save billions - 4 or 5 manufacturers were approved by the Biden administration. It'd still be hundreds under Trump, name brand only. 

There's billions in subsidies for renewable energy generation. That's clean energy that doesn't give poor people cancer in their 40s; and if you need proof - look at the cancer rates in Cancer Alley, Louisiana. A place where so many refineries were placed around POOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE sold terrible deal after terrible deal that death emanates from the area. You had the privilege of not having to breathe that shit in under Chevron Deference. Now the Supreme Court, a conservative majority, says it can happen in your neighborhood - and it very well might. A third of that court was picked by Trump. 

You talk about a puppet - I'd suggest looking in the mirror and asking yourself why you'd support any policy that benefits any Fortune 500 corporation such as tax cuts for them, or tariffs that trickle down and cut into your hard earned pay check, and then ask why the Trump admin gave billions to corporations used for stock buy backs, but only gave you $1200 during COVID.",0,1719808129,,,0,lb2z1r4,t3_1ds46yj,t1_lb2n0u9,1719808144,1,False,millenials,t5_2xzp8

Her faith was so strong that I almost half believe it myself. Till her dying day she never asked why her. And only cared about the people she was leaving behind. We did a lot of talking about death. It was a blessing and a curse to know from the beginning that she didn't have long. (Pancreatic cancer. Pretty much an execution of the digestive system.) I'm younger than I should be as a widow, but facing that made us both stronger. We were never closer than those last few months; the small stuff all falls away. What remains is what's important. I am happy she is no longer suffering. I still don't believe in heaven, but I do believe because I have to that my baby girl is okay now. She won. Because even though she lost her life the cancer died too. That probably doesn't bring any comfort like I meant it. But .. you shouldn't be afraid to die, I think. It's just our next step.

allemm,,,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal. 

I'm sorry your wife is having such a hard time, and I hope that with a bit of time she will feel a bit less overwhelmed. I imagine that right now the pain is mentally and emotionally draining.

spectredirector,,,"Stop. Stop and think. Joe challenged Trump to a debate - that was dumb, for a few reasons. (1) It elevated Trump, who is a convicted felon awaiting trial, and indicted on espionage charges currently - that's not a person you put side by side with any president for any reason. Biden was thinking about a comparison to Trump like you are thinking about a comparison to Trump.
 
Trump the sack of shit physical body and mind is NOT the reason Joe can lose. Joe can't lose if he's 20 years younger, the incumbency and a fuck up of epic proportions is a bad hole for a loved candidate. Biden is not loved, his popularity numbers have never gone up once since taking office, not really. And he saved democracy. So what gives? 
 
He's only got one flaw - and it's both literally and metaphorically fatal. 
 
He's TOO old. 
 
Now that's an opinion. It wasn't mine prior to Thursday, and his performance at the debates doesn't have me questioning the answer he gave to that question, it strictly has me questioning how long I've been denying truth to myself. 
 
Forget Trump was side by side to compare to our sitting president. 
 
Joe ""lost"" the debate he called for while acting with hubris he couldn't actually deliver on. That's what bullies do, we know that's not Biden, so we assume in good faith he just made a mistake and had a legit bad night. 
 
But what he did was appear like live action Abe Simpson. The hour was downhill, and he said ""we beat medicare"" - Trump landed the best zinger of the night - and I can't remember being more shocked by a thing. Sincerely the new thing this diehard Biden supporter learned about Trump was he was capable of making a decent joke. That's some wit, and some is more than Trump actually has. I know that. The idiot undecided doesn't. They saw a corpse and a man who could land a softball zinger on a stationary target. 
 
Biden lost epically because he fed the knock on him and went beyond it. He lost to plaque buildup and age related degenerative health. He's past life expectancy, and while Trump is too, Biden demonstrated it. When his only flaw, his fatal flaw - truly and honest with myself - is he looks geriatric. He moves like a fall risk. There's now video of him staring blankly and squinting, the word salad is Biden but now it's old, slow, raspy, noticeably old. The presidency ages young men. Trump is kept alive by evil magic, he'll outlive the tanning beds he gives cancer. Yes HPV. Yes, those tanning beds will be denied medical care in Texas. Trump will live until death proves its possible. Joe showed me what awaiting death looks like. He lost by himself to himself. 
 
The self own is so epic, that it needs an explanation better than pure incompetence. Biden didn't wanna lose 10 points in the polls in a weekend, no one thought there was a fallout as bad as this possible. And that's the thing - if that's what Biden knew the risk was, and he went thru with it and that was his best work possible. Well... We are only in good conscience voting against Trump. The morally correct and necessary thing. But we are hurting an old man doing it, we are enabling him, and he's not fit to be in charge. Trump is not only still around, but they just handed him more than Putin could. A democratic party with an incumbent president who just tanked the election and caused abject chaos in any certainty he's the nominee. 
 
That needs certainty. Yesterday. And there's only one way to do that when the knock is ""too old"" and the proof is the attack ads that debate will nickle and dime everything away from Joe from now until November. If Hillary had accidentally released incriminating emails by leaving them in a Denny's ladies room, and Mike Dukakis decided to wear them as a helmet while piloting an Apache attack helicopter, the noise Howard Dean would make has a better chance of ticking up in poll number then Biden does - between now and whenever he calls it quits. He showed his age, and his age is the problem. I think he nullified himself and the party knows it, Biden won't quit. It's turmoil, and the worst possible thing. 
 
Trump doesn't factor into any of that self own except he was standing on stage by Biden's request to reap all the benefits. 
 
Trump going to North Korea was gross, cuz he elevated a despot to the level of the US Presidency. 
 
Well....
 
Incompetence or age. Spectacular mistake. Historical. 
 
There's another debate scheduled. It's that simple. Joe goes on stage and isn't 25 years younger, well that's another big L in the side by side. And if Joe now bows out, probably the only option to not risk this again - well that's a loss, he's bailing after looking old. It's all loss. And the solution isn't readily available.

Putin, Xi, and MBS find this whole democracy thing hilarious. As authoritarians they just cackle and shrug at the thought of going through the extra steps that democracy requires. 

Why not just tell people what to do and if they don’t do it, bribe them, throw them out a window or flush them down a drain? 

It’s why they had to use the Texas based Koch brothers who had deep relationships with Russian oil oligarchs since Stalins era  and Harlan Crow to buy the SCOTUS.

https://youtu.be/mn_t7a2hJfQ?si=hzioP8URJAMFNch4

Alito’s (Koch funded) heritage foundation ties, Thomas’s RV. Kavanaughs mortgage, all the trips to bohemian grove. They were all part of the bigger plan to destabilize the United States, spread the cancer of corruption and tear it all down so they can build oligarch row in Teton National park  Wyoming so the lazy old oligarchs can retire from the Moscow mob life. 

Kleptocracy is biological.  It consumes everything in its path like a parasite.

During Russian perestroika it ate Dostoevsky and  Tchaikovsky and shit out alcoholism and hopelessness. Now anyone with skills has left and 1 in 5 has no indoor plumbing. 

Justin Kennedy (justice kennedys son) was the inside man at Deutsche bank that was getting all trumps toxic loans approved.

No other bank but Deutsche bank would touch trump and his imaginary valuations.

Why?

Because Deutsche bank was infested with Russian oligarchs.

In 91 the Soviet Union failed and for a bit they hid all of the money they stole from Russias grandmas under a mattress until the oligarchs started buying condos at trump towers.

They made stops in Ukraine, Cyprus and London but they landed in New York because that was what everyone wanted in the early 90’s.

Levi’s, Pepsi, Madonna tapes that weren’t smuggled bootlegs, and Wall Street cocaine 

They all bought new suits and cars and changed their title from “most violent street thug in moscow” to “respectable Russian oligarch” but they didn’t leave their human trafficking, narcotics or extortion behind.  It was their most lucrative business model and frankly, they enjoy the violence.

The reason trump cosplays as a patriot is because he is feeding on the U.S. middle class, not because he is one of us.

The GOP fell in line to MAGA because Trump did what pathological liars do, he told them anything they wanted to hear.  

Trump with his money laundering and child raping buddy Epstein, Roger Stone with his kompromat sex clubs in DC and Nevada, and Paul Manafort with his election rigging pretty much everywhere, sat down at a table with Mike Johnson and the extreme religious right and convinced them that they were the same. 

They self evidently are not, at least at a surface level, but there is enough common ground in the exploitation of children and desire for unilateral control (project 2025) that they became the worlds weirdest and most dysfunctional orgy.  The religious right is naive enough to believe trump at his word so they have made him their defacto savior. 

Trump belongs to the authoritarians.  The GOP now belongs to trump. But their overall goal is the same-

Kleptocracy. 

Putin, Xi and MBS all aligned together last year to attempt the BRICS overthrow of the USD.  It failed but it didn’t stop Xi’s push on Taiwan or MBS’s part in the plan.

Putin, Xi, and MBS find this whole democracy thing hilarious. As authoritarians they just cackle and shrug at the thought of going through the extra steps that democracy requires. 

Why not just tell people what to do and if they don’t do it, bribe them, throw them out a window or flush them down a drain? 

It’s why they had to use the Texas based Koch brothers who had deep relationships with Russian oil oligarchs since Stalins era  and Harlan Crow to buy the SCOTUS.

https://youtu.be/mn_t7a2hJfQ?si=hzioP8URJAMFNch4

Alito’s (Koch funded) heritage foundation ties, Thomas’s RV. Kavanaughs mortgage, all the trips to bohemian grove. They were all part of the bigger plan to destabilize the United States, spread the cancer of corruption and tear it all down so they can build oligarch row in Teton National park  Wyoming so the lazy old oligarchs can retire from the Moscow mob life. 

Kleptocracy is biological.  It consumes everything in its path like a parasite.

During Russian perestroika it ate Dostoevsky and  Tchaikovsky and shit out alcoholism and hopelessness. Now anyone with skills has left and 1 in 5 has no indoor plumbing. 

Justin Kennedy (justice kennedys son) was the inside man at Deutsche bank that was getting all trumps toxic loans approved.

No other bank but Deutsche bank would touch trump and his imaginary valuations.

Why?

Because Deutsche bank was infested with Russian oligarchs.

In 91 the Soviet Union failed and for a bit they hid all of the money they stole from Russias grandmas under a mattress until the oligarchs started buying condos at trump towers.

They made stops in Ukraine, Cyprus and London but they landed in New York because that was what everyone wanted in the early 90’s.

Levi’s, Pepsi, Madonna tapes that weren’t smuggled bootlegs, and Wall Street cocaine 

They all bought new suits and cars and changed their title from “most violent street thug in moscow” to “respectable Russian oligarch” but they didn’t leave their human trafficking, narcotics or extortion behind.  It was their most lucrative business model and frankly, they enjoy the violence.

Guiliani redirected NYPD resources away from their new Russian friends and onto the Italian mob.  It let him claim he cleaned up New York and it let the russians  launder their money through casinos and then commercial real estate when 3 of trumps casino execs started asking how he managed to be the only person in history to bankrupt casinos and they all died in a helicopter crash 
https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/nyregion/copter-crash-kills-3-aides-of-trump.html
The attorney/client privilege is the continual work around they use to accept bribes and make payments up and down the mob pyramid.

The insane property valuations coming out in trumps fraud trial are a necessity of the money laundering cycle that duetschebank was doing with the Russians.
https://youtu.be/ZlIagcttGY0?si=EkbGnoAsDVqJ3sjT
The reason trump cosplays as a patriot is because he is feeding on the U.S. middle class, not because he is one of us.

The GOP fell in line to MAGA because Trump did what pathological liars do, he told them anything they wanted to hear.  

Trump with his money laundering and child raping buddy Epstein, Roger Stone with his kompromat sex clubs in DC and Nevada, and Paul Manafort with his election rigging pretty much everywhere, sat down at a table with Mike Johnson and the extreme religious right and convinced them that they were the same. 

They self evidently are not, at least at a surface level, but there is enough common ground in the exploitation of children and desire for unilateral control (project 2025) that they became the worlds weirdest and most dysfunctional orgy.  The religious right is naive enough to believe trump at his word so they have made him their defacto savior. 

Trump belongs to the authoritarians.  The GOP now belongs to trump. But their overall goal is the same-

Kleptocracy. 

Putin, Xi and MBS all aligned together last year to attempt the BRICS overthrow of the USD.  It failed but it didn’t stop Xi’s push on Taiwan or MBS’s part in the plan.

dfinkelstein,,,"Add ""depression and anxiety"" to everybody else's answer who didn't include one already.
    
The frequency with which I read laundry posts if diagnoses with multiple labels which you by definition cannot be diagnosed with simultaneously is astounding. Or I guess not astounding at all when used by people to define themselves by a bunch of labels with limited use and dubious history and meaning.
       
Depression and ADHD both nearly always present with massive amounts of anxiety. You can't get diagnosed with ""anxiety"" in the first place. Everybody has ""anxiety."" 
    
There are anxiety disorders, and they each have a name.
      
I so often hear ""I have bipolar, depression--"" STOP. You cannot have both. It is meaningless to have both. There's a reason bipolar replaces a depression diagnosis. 
     
""I have OCD, generalized anxiety--"" nope. OCD is your anxiety disorder. It causes generalized anxiety. That's where your anxiety is coming from. From having one of the top ten most disabling illnesses bar none humans have. All illnesses. Cancer, diabetes, dementia, broken bones. OCD is one of the very worst of any kind. It makes no sense to tack on lesser anxiety disorders as well. It just makes no sense. 
      
And so on. 
     
People completely lose the plot on what these words mean. They mean very little, really. Your depression may have something or almost nothing to do with mine. The longer we go on using lists of words and making assumptions, the less time we spend actually understanding, communicating, and making sense. 
    
These words are STARTING points. Not ENDING points. They give you a heading for first line treatments. Contra-indicated treatments. Therapiest that might work. Ones that probably (*probably*) won't. Things other people who maybe had something similar tried. Ways to contact and meet them. People who helped them. Ways they helped. 
    
These words give you a heading. They don't fly your plane. You fly your plane. And you're the only one who can tell for sure if the heading you're flying is helping or hurting you. 
       
Just because you have ADHD, does not mean that any given stimulant will affect you a certain way. Almost no psychoactive drugs work that way. Just because you get manic on SSRIs or  antipsychotics cure your depression, doesn't mean you ""are bipolar.""
    
It's a useful idea to pursue. Hey, what if there's a word besides ""depression"" that might point me in a useful direction? Hmm. What does it mean, this heading? What does it suggest, predict, and explain? Does it make sense? FOR ME?
      
That's all we're doing with these words. Some are more testable and predictive and useful than others. We need SOMETHING to go on. To organize our treatments and research. Our drugs. And so on.
  
But guess what the most effective BY FAR treatments for EVERY mental illness EVER have always been? It's not antidepressants or Xanax or haldol or caffeine or nicotine or ozycotin.
   
It's not DBT or CBT or ACT or EMDR or Nos or fMRI or ABC.
    
It's the most boring obvious shit ever. It's diet, exercise, socializing, music, dance, movement, exercise, community, purpose, creating, expressing, connecting, imagining, experiencing, moving, exercising, and exercising. 
      
Does this cure diseases? Sometimes. Mostly, no. Pretty rarely. But it's more effective by leaps and bounds than any other standardized treatment regiments. It helps the most people the most and it's not even close. 
      
Which tells me what? That the words, the labels, will not save us. Because these interventions I'm gesturing at are universal. They're the same for everyone. And yet, everyone finds different help in different parts of those ideas. They find different paths to them and ways to access and experience and enact them. 
     
And drugs? Drugs are drugs. It's one thing. You take it or you don't. There's dose, and timing, and sometimes the formulation makes a difference, but usually not so much that it's going to change your life. But when you find enough of the other boring stuff that insurance companies can't charge for, then that can and does finish the puzzle and set you on the path to real wellness 
     
I don't know anyone who's been cured by drugs alone. They all have made changed to their lifestyle. They found purpose, meaning, belonging. Community. They changed their eating habits. Sleeping habits. They exercise. They socialize--passively, actively, whatever works. They find ways to practice thinking and solving problems. They journal. They find ways to express themselves. They meditate. They do yoga or Tai chi. They move. They swim or bike. They find meaning in small rituals. They build simple routines. They exercise. 
       
So what use are these labels? They can be used. They can make  the difference between life and death. They often do. 
    
But we mustn't forget what they are. ""diagnosis"" makes it sound like a type 1 diabetic who's twice nearly died from a coma and been resuscitated, and now has been prescribed insulin and can go on to live a largely uneventful unremarkable normal life.
    
That's not what this is. That's not what any of this is.",0,1719810459,,,0,lb337te,t3_1drub1c,t3_1drub1c,1719810474,1,False,ADHD,t5_2qnwb
