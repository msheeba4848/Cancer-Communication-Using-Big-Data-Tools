Bagambe256,,,"As his follower on Patreon, this is the email I received on 30/6/2024

""Hi, this is Nina. I‚Äôm Kento‚Äôs wife (some of you may remember me from early Kento Bento videos). Kento needed assistance with writing and publishing this post (more on this later), so I wanted to be transparent about that. The following are his words:

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone. I missed you all.¬†  


I know an update is long overdue, and I apologize for that. I hope this post clears a few things up.¬†  


Let me address the Patreon situation first. During my extended break from YouTube, I have been pausing payments to ensure patrons aren‚Äôt charged, as I felt that I shouldn‚Äôt be accepting pledges if I‚Äôm not publishing videos. Unfortunately, Patreon doesn‚Äôt offer a way to¬†*indefinitely*¬†pause payments without taking down my page entirely, so I‚Äôve had to log in and manually activate this function each month for the past couple of years. While this workaround isn‚Äôt perfect, it has mostly worked (barring the odd pledge slipping through).  


However, this month will be the first time I may not be able to pause payments as I will be undergoing invasive surgery. The healing process is expected to be lengthy, but I‚Äôm hopeful for a healthy recovery**.**¬†Moreover, I‚Äôve reflected on messages I‚Äôve received from various patrons over the years who did not like my decision to pause payments. Their main concern was that it didn‚Äôt align with the concept of Patreon, where the choice to pledge should rest with the patrons. By repeatedly pausing payments, I was essentially taking away that choice.  


Taking all these factors into account, I‚Äôve decided that I will no longer pause payments moving forward. I didn‚Äôt want to catch anyone off guard, so this is just a heads up for the months ahead.  


Secondly, I want to address my personal situation. I‚Äôve heard some frustrations about the vagueness of the information I‚Äôve provided regarding my extended break, and I completely understand. I‚Äôve previously mentioned some of the health issues I‚Äôve been dealing with, but there is one that I haven‚Äôt yet mentioned due to the uncertainty surrounding it. For the sake of transparency and to avoid any further confusion, I want to provide more details. I have been battling lung cancer for a while now, and¬†it has taken up much of my time. Balancing this with caring for baby Sofia has been demanding.¬†The coming months, in particular, will be unpredictable as I undergo intensive treatments and therapies, including the surgery I previously mentioned (which may have happened by the time this is posted).  


Despite everything, I am optimistic and look forward to getting through this. I‚Äôm very eager to put this chapter behind me. While I know these words may sound repetitive, I am committed to returning to making videos as soon as I am able. Your patience and understanding are deeply appreciated, and they keep me motivated to push forward.



Thank you for your ongoing support.

3DFarmer,,,"I went to one recently after my neurologist said something more was up. I brought a list of everything I've been feeling, even the small stuff like weird nail changes and a pre-cancer diagnosis. She did a full body exam, pressed on all my joints and then told me that I'm a little more flexible then most people and that's probably causing my pain. She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone. I felt like I needed to argue for it but she did listen to me. I felt so much better after a week that she put me on Sulfasalazine and I'm waiting to see the effects.

  
I would ask for labs, maybe for the HLA gene and see where it goes. We are young, I'm just 29 but it's taken years of arguing to get someone to listen. It really wasn't until my neurologist reassured me that doctors will ignore me and to keep at it, that I put my thoughts of being an annoying patient aside and to keep at it that I actually got results.

raccoon-nb,,/·ê† - Àï-„ÉûÔΩ°Àö·∂ª ùóì ,"It's about the cat's health.

Cats don't understand the concept of gender, and therefore having no testicles does not really psychologically effect them. They aren't losing their manliness or anything. Generally, they're running around, acting as normal within half an hour to an hour of the procedure. They don't even know what happened.

Neutering is mostly done for the health benefits.

As the procedure involves the removal of reproductive organs, it eliminates health risks associated with those organs. A neutered male cat will never get testicular cancer. A spayed female cat will never get uterine or ovarian cancer. A spayed female cat will also never have to suffer pyometra (a painful, potentially fatal uterine infection common in older intact female cats).

Changes in hormone levels also decrease the risk of other issues. Neutered male cats are less likely to suffer prostate diseases. Spayed female cats are less likely to develop mammary tumours.

Female cats go into their first heat at an average of 6 months of age, sometimes as young as 4 months of age, and while at that age it could be very dangerous for them to get pregnant (comparable to a human child or teen pregnancy), cats have no knowledge of medical concepts like that, and they breed purely on instinct. Having male and female cats who aren't spayed/neutered may very well lead to pregnancy/birth complications as well as cat overpopulation and hoarding. Cats also have no sense of biological family and do not hesitate to breed with cats they are closely related to, so if intact cats of opposite sex who are related to each other are kept, inbreeding will become a huge problem.

Male unneutered cats do not go through heat cycles but are fertile year-round from the age of 4-8 months. They often go through intense sexual frustration and stress, leading to territorial behaviour. It's not good for their psychological health, and it can lead them to get into fights or wander too far and become ill or injured alone.

It has been found that neutered male cats live an average of 62% longer than unneutered/intact males, and spayed female cats live an average of 39% longer than unspayed/entire females.

It also has a very low rate of complication, and almost never has long-term effects.

For the above reasons, it is strongly recommended by welfare organisations and veterinarians alike to spay/neuter pet cats.

PaedsRants,,,"Paeds here! Unfortunately this all depends on age + pathology/specialty + local pathways, so I can't really give a generic answer for you, but if you are a permanent/regular member of staff and not a locum GP doing a shift somewhere new then you should really be making the effort to get to know the pathways in your area (or know where to find them). I'm sure you can appreciate how frustrating it is for a busy paeds reg to be getting GP calls about e.g. a 13yo with ?SUFE, when they know that should be a direct referral to ortho with no paeds input required.


For the record, I do not know of a single pathway that requires you as the referring GP to discuss the patient with 2 separate teams, so if an ortho/gen surg is asking you to do that after they've accepted the patient, you can and should push back on this. If their protocol demands a paeds review for every child with abdo pain under 12 or whatever, that is for them to sort out, NOT you as the referring GP.


If in doubt + worried + busy++, by all means send them to ED with a letter and let ED figure it out, but that is very suboptimal for obvious reasons.


A few broad principles to consider (and definitely don't take as gospel and do check how it's done locally):


- the younger they are, the more likely it is you need to refer to paeds first rather than to specialty directly. Anything over 6 is not that young, and *probably* doesn't need to see paeds first. Anything over 12 is basically small adult territory, and almost certainly doesn't need to see paeds first.


- is your local hospital a tertiary or DGH? If it's tertiary, there is generally more scope to refer direct to specialty, e.g. discuss your ?quinsy directly with the paeds ENT team. If it's remote DGH, then probably should run it by the local paeds reg first.


- how ""acutely unwell"" are they? If it's an infective pathology with risk of sepsis, or there's cancer high on the differential, it's more likely they need to see paeds first. But again, if it's barndoor surgical like an abscess or septic joint, you can usually refer directly to the surgical specialty and let them bleep paeds as necessary.


- gen surg/paeds surg: there is often an age cutoff for appendicitis, e.g. above 12 the adult gen surgeons at the DGH will see, below 12 they need to see paeds first, who will refer to paeds surg as necessary. Likewise, for paediatric-specific pathology like pyloric stenosis, refer to paeds first.


- ENT: probably the most pathology-specific and variable as per local pathways. If it's really a barndoor ENT pathology that's likely to need surgical intervention (thinking textbook quinsy or mastoiditis), then I would strongly encourage you to refer to ENT directly, even at a DGH - but pathways vary.


In summary, you just have to learn what the pathways are locally, which will come with time and experience.",0,1719849816,,,0,lb579b1,t3_1dspn56,t3_1dspn56,1719849831,5,False,GPUK,t5_8aw5or

GoldfishChronicle,,,"This is related, but not the same. I hope it can help you anyways. I was the close friend/girlfriend (13 yrs) of a man with terminal colorectal cancer; my own father passed away in 2021 from prostate cancer. His son was in the final year of his degree when he was admitted to emergency surgery for removal of the blockage in his bowels, it was the first any one of us knew of his condition. We only knew he had been unwell but the doctors thought it might be colitis and they were still testing when things rapidly fell apart. 

Truth be told in the hospital, his son was in shock, so young to be confronted with such a situation. He was concerned with how he would balance his job, relationship and school. He looked like he wanted to run away, back to normalcy; I didn't blame him. But I admit to feeling a little frustrated, because of my own experience I know the guilt that arises after, despite the fact that I was with my own father every step of the way... I was worried he would regret his actions and words at that time. But I am not him, and he is not me, so held my tongue. He ended up completing his final year and graduating. His father passed away just weeks before graduation. He made it to say goodbye.

While my loved one was sick, he would save his energy to mask his pain and worries in front of his son. After recovering from the first surgery, I told him, he should reserve his time for his son, he needed to rely on his son, his son needed to feel needed, to know that he helped in a meaningful way, or else he might pay the price later on. Not quit school, but to be confided in, or asked to help every so often. Not fully sheltered. I don't know if he took the information to heart. 

What I do know is this: You could have been in the same room as your mother, day in and day out and still feel guilty. The brain looks for the cause, it wants to know how to avoid the pain again, it wants the source. It will play tricks on you, having you rethink things over and over again. A child is meant to diverge from the path of their parent at some point, lead their own life, separate, but together in spirit. They didn't want to break your path, ""even if I cannot go forward, they can"". This was her wish, she didn't want you to suffer then, even though she can't save you from it now. That was her choice, you can be angry if you don't like it, because valuable information was withheld from you. That is fair. 

Your path was meant to move away from them at some point, the death feels very different when your path was tied to walking with the departed as a life partner; be gentle with your father. You lost the same person, but you are grieving different relationships. You can tell him you don't want to be kept in the dark ever again, and tell him how it has affected you when you are both ready. Anger is normal, it will pass. You will want to fight something, anyone, anything, when you are not reconciled to what has happened. (I am guilty of this too.)

Your mother set out to protect you for as long as possible... She did her job. You did what she wanted you to do. Over time forgive yourself, and just know she loved you very much. She was probably content with you out of the storm and yet worried for you all at once. Be angry, be sad, feel guilty, feel numb, but do not despair. Do not lose hope or the courage to move forward later, when you slowly regain your strength. She did not want you to stagnate, do not forsake her wish. Be an example for your father, he will be lonely, let him know you still have each other. Let him know you still want him to witness your accomplishments and want him there to tell you he is proud. Let him know there is still life after loss, even if it doesn't feel that there will be ever again. It probably feels really unfair that he is almost making you be the strong one. Let the adult part of you listen carefully to your inner child who is rampaging and inconsolable right now. Don't admonish them, they've just suffered a catastrophic loss, their whole world is changed, be soft with them, let them have a few free passes, one day, the tears will be less and less frequent. Life will be different, but the sun will come out again.

Be kind to yourself, this hurt takes time to scar over. Don't rush, be patient. You will heal. (I'm so sorry this is so long, I am grieving too and I tend to ramble when I am sad and introspective.)",0,1719829348,,,0,lb3usm9,t3_1dsogs2,t3_1dsogs2,1719829365,4,False,grief,t5_2s369
herbal_thought,,,"Watching the man or woman you love and adore suffering and dying can do some serious damage to our minds. It affects us in so many ways for the rest of our lives. More so if we are codependent on them for our happiness in life. 

But we need to try and find a way to make the pain less, to become less miserable, otherwise what is left of our life will be a wasted mess of frustrations, loneliness and depression.  

But I can recognize that raising two kids alone means you have no time or energy left over for you, or to find a way to heal or to deal with all that you are struggling with. I am in deep awe of you and your strength to continue like this for seven years and continue taking care of your kids. I have been struggling with my wife's death from her breast cancer for five years and I am without children. So I am sure you don't feel like it right now but you are in some ways incredible. But you need to find something, anything that you can do that can help you escape and repair even for short moments. 

The first few years I had used guided meditation initially to fix my insomnia but also just to find a way to reduce my misery. It sounds silly but the goal of meditation is to teach you how to focus on your breathing and in turn not notice our negative thoughts and the nervous chatter of the mind. Our mind will never shut up and will always talk crap about ourselves, so the less you hear all that crap, the easier it might be for you to heal. I had used the Headspace app mostly because I was too exhausted to go our after work and I didn't really want to be around other people. And the cost of the subscription for a year was cheaper than a therapy session. 

They also offer therapy-like session that deal with stuff like grief, lonyness, and sadness wrapped around a meditation training. Below is a sample of the grief sessions. There are thirty 15 minute sessions which you can do once or twice a day after the kids are in bed. If you think you can get some brief moments of escape or peace, try completing their grief, sadness and anxiety sessions. You might not feel better at first, in fact the grief sessions might make you feel worse, but if you keep it up, over time you might find your pain and suffering a little bit less.

Note if you can afford to or can get access to a social worker or a therapist for free please do it. It can also help in small ways. 

Another thing you can do on your own is think about who were you before you met your husband. Can you explore who that woman was then and think about the things you liked to do before you met him and then had kids? If you can remember and do just one of those things in the spare time, maybe that too would help you survive this life better.",0,1719835365,,,0,lb45crx,t3_1dslzey,t3_1dslzey,1719835383,2,False,widowers,t5_2swuk
Spirited_Ice5834,,,"We owned 2 houses side by side. One was rented out and I wanted to move my elderly grandma there at some point because she needed help with some every day tasks but still was ok to leave by herself. One of the tenants had breast cancer. We waited to give them notice. Then we spoke to them just explaining the situation. Then a year later they still did not make any progress in finding a new place to live. 
Because of their vulnerable situation, we also did not increase the rent for few years. So the situation was they could not find anything similar for that amount as we were charging them below market rent. I was getting frustrated because I needed that house for a genuine reason but I also did not want to cause any distress to the tenants. After about a year we just had to give a firm notice with a moving out date because they were not going to move out otherwise at any point in time.",0,1719835795,,,0,lb467lx,t3_1dsoqkg,t3_1dsoqkg,1719835812,6,False,shitrentals,t5_8ro26x
Honest_Objective67,ep,SA,"The deaths aren't tracked because it's likely more than 80 % of the deaths are male and if this is put into a forum or article that cannot be ignored, the false narrative of ""women have it tougher then men"" will roll over on its face.

All the outcry to two dozen female deaths from alleged DV (alleged because the cases haven't been finalised yet) and a royal commission and billion dollar band aid plus all the shelters and services on offer. 

Ignoring that more men die from suicide then women die from cancer, DV and violent crime combind. Not to mention if we take into account homelessness, inequitable legal system etc. 

All this is said not saying women have it easy necessarily either. Just more venting frustrations with seeing men suffer and the society around them unanimously not giving two shits about it.",0,1719814609,,,0,lb39yao,t3_1dsi8c0,t3_1dsi8c0,1719814625,-34,False,Adelaide,t5_2r1ca
cindysinner,,,"Maybe ask her if she calls a plumber when plumbing is out? A roofer when too get‚Äôs damaged? 

So go to your doctor for a medical condition. They spend 8 years in school (undergrad, med school) plus 3 yrs min for specialty training (varies by specialty.) 

I am so pissed at the eroding trust in all specialists. So very frustrating. I‚Äôm a doctor and cannot believe how dumb everyone has become. 

Ask your mom about the latest lung cancer treatment options or even the different types of breast cancer or the risk factors/prognosis of each cancer with different treatment option, or the pharmacology of each type of cancer treatments. 

I mean - she has done her research so she should know all of this, right?/s

In all seriousness, though, wishing your mom many, many more healthy years despite her quacky ideas.",0,1719814663,,,0,lb3a19w,t3_1drqi4k,t3_1drqi4k,1719814679,1,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi

MountainsAndSnow,,,"Also, it's frustrating when they say ""Jesus suffered more than any of us ever will"". 

But I actually don't recall Jesus being sex trafficked as a child and then growing up as an adult with severe PTSD from it. 

I  don't recall Jesus having children and those children all dying in horrific ways and him having to live with that for the rest of his life.

 I don't recall Jesus suffering and agonising terminal cancer for months on end. 

His death was brutal, but people have been skinned alive, which to me seems far worse. 

There are many people in history and present times, who have suffered more atrocity and pain than Jesus ever did.",0,1719820663,,,0,lb3ip6h,t3_1doaxvp,t3_1doaxvp,1719820679,1,False,excatholic,t5_2sdlb
Daynananana,,,"This was the first thing I assumed would happen, people making accounts acting as charities or making names like ‚ÄúDyingOfCancer or ‚ÄúI-need-a-liver‚Äù ..

And with the people that might have entered the extra @ by mistake, they
 Made it very clear multiple times that you must enter I a real working Venmo account to be awarded the prize. If someone wins that is in that situation people would and shoukd be furious since we go into these games knowing the rules and concept are vague but we will figure it out as we go, and for them to disregard one of the few disqualifiers that they (made to look) carved in stone would be a mess. It says that they would not be eligible for thr prize pool but doesn‚Äôt say that they would be disqualified from playing the game.. so not sure how they
lol treat it but hope they say something soon.

It makes it more frustrating that on the original list everyone saw as people signed up, it became obvious that the accounts with an @ were at the top. There may be some that accidentally entered the info, but there‚Äôs no way all of them did especially when we can see accounts that don‚Äôt exist at all that someone is just using to help their real account‚Ä¶

sirfletchalot,,,"I'd like to think I've dealt with cancer head on, on a personal level, after losing my mum to small cell lung cancer the day before my daughters first birthday, then my dad also to small cell lung cancer, 3 days before my daughters 7th birthday.  

But holy shit! as a dad, I couldn't even begin to comprehend what you are going through. the emotions, the pain, the struggle of not being able to protect your own child from a disease so invasive and destructive. I am so so sorry that you and your family are having to do this, and I know only too well that nothing anyone does or says can change anything.  

You are so strong, just to be able to talk about this, and I admire your courage tremendously. I wish there was something I could say or do to alleviate some of the pain from you, even if only temporarily.  

I mean this from the bottom of my heart.....if you need someone to rant at, vent your anger and frustration, or even someone to just talk about random mundane stuff to bring some kind of normality to your mind, even if just for a short while, my DMs are open to you, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
