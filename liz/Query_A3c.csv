So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father’s situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister’s college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn’t have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn’t happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn’t respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she’s “poor” and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop “holding her tuition over her head”. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever “pay me back” nor have I ever “held it over her head”. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn’t realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she’s still young. She once again didn’t reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It’s a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn’t replying to my texts and I’m just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn’t from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

serenerepose,,,"Sooooooo, let's talk about that historically!

Air quality in the IE was horrid up until the late 90's when a series of laws went into effect to clean up air quality across Southern California. Since the IE is a giant basin east of Los Angeles and Los Angeles gets an easterly off shore wind almost daily, our own poor air quality would combine with the smog from Los Angeles and it made the air extremely bad.

After legislation went into effect to clean up LA and OC's air quality, in addition to our own, air quality in the IE improved substantially. Keyword, substantially. It didn't become exceptional or pristine, but it noticeably improved- including rates of asthma, emphysema, lung cancers, etc that are all associated with poor air quality. 

Unfortunately, the air has started to get bad again because of 2 factors: population increases and warehouses. 

The population in the IE is expected to nearly double by 2050 as people are priced out of LA, OC, and even San Diego housing. More people means more traffic, especially since most of those people have to commute to LA and OC still. 

Warehouses have exploded in the IE over the past 10 years and very few cities are slowing down their approval of new warehouses. In fact, 48% of all good shipped in America move through Inland Empire warehouses. You know what that means? A LOT of tractor trailers putting out emissions. As more warehouses go up, more trucks move through the IE. Those trucks aren't just driving, they're also idling at warehouses for long stretches as they're loaded and drivers complete work at loading docks. More warehouses also means more airplane traffic delivering freight. Airplanes have very high emissions and we have had freight air traffic increase by almost 40% in the past decade.

So how did we live this way for so long? We didn't. Our air quality was improving and was noticeably for for several decades until housing prices skyrocketed and warehouses checkered the landscape.

Btw, developers are required to environmental impact reports for most of these warehouse and housing sites. Most of the reports note that the projects will substantially increase air pollution and worsen air quality in the city- but city councils are rubber stamping them anyways because, you guessed, political donations.

If you're pissed about that, message me- I know people who want to do something about it.",0,1719812333,,,0,lb36clk,t3_1ds7ajp,t3_1ds7ajp,1719812350,2,False,InlandEmpire,t5_2rjtz
BigRedDoggyDawg,,,"I'll start by saying I upvoted your post. And 100 percent good for you, it is excellent that you broke down a lot of barriers to get someone to say, ""hey doc this time it's bad"". Also I personally never have a go at anyone for decisions they make in an austere environment, most people can have a sane pros and cons discussion and reflect on it. Take away a practice that might be different to yours but still tempered by yours. Anyone who isn't that sensible is unlikely to respond to you because you are meaner. Makes no sense, I have no time for people who approach supervising ED juniors that way. They are incivility, and they kill patients and doctors with their stupidity. 

Some devils advocacy. 

At a certain level in the pulmonary tree there is disagreement between specialist world wide radiologists as to what is and is not pulmonary embolism 

At a certain level we don't and can't know who benefits from life long anti coagulation. Some provocations are unknown and so are their disappearance. 

There is a probability which frankly I'm not well read enough to quantify, though I imagine it's not large, that CTPA all chest pains without say ECG signs of right heart strain, echo findings, HD instability etc. Picks up 'ghost' PE and starts life long anti coagulation. 

Let's go further. PE is a high mortality condition. True. Is that understanding from big PEs, yes. We probably miss PEs all the time, it is probably a spectrum condition that could be less fatal than we think. 

Now let me add in another wrinkle, breakthrough PE exists, the diagnosis of PE is probably made much harder when someone is anti coagulated. 

Put all of this together. Is it wise to do a CTPA without a significant pre test probability? Does it condemn a patient to an imaginary radiological diagnosis, give them the risks of being anti coagulated and then make the diagnosis of a break through PE some 10 years later when they have cancer much much harder. 

I don't know. Now your case was probably big old fuck off PE and your gestalt was correct. It's just something to consider. 

Reflect on whether you should do the same action 100 times, who would you save, who would you kill? 

I haven't even touched on the radiation exposure at all. Though I'm a bit of a hormesis believer myself...

hyphenomicon,,,"I got it from my life. Over the course of two years, right after I was getting my life in good shape after cancer and becoming interesting to women, I was sexually harassed by a diversity hire who didn't do any work, falsely accused of breaking into a sorority girl's home as her way of retaliating for telling her I thought she was manipulative and I didn't trust her enough to go to her house (I still have no idea where it is or was), which included a literal fake crime scene and report to the police, and finally targeted by a psychopath who used feminism to get positions of power from which she could prey on others in cons and scams via a rumor campaign that cost me scholarships, employment positions, the esteem of someone I cared deeply for, tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly got me kicked out of school. I have a PTSD diagnosis from this and suffer from extremely bad hypervigilance related to social interaction as a result. I am terrified of other human beings now.


Feminists have used me for sex while feigning friendship, promised me honesty and help with my high-functioning autism while lying and manipulating me, spread untrue rumors alleging I'm schizophrenic after I trusted them with knowledge of my disability (definitely not, no symptoms, currently receiving mental health care and my provider has confirmed my reasoning and perceptions are sound), denied me the opportunity to speak in my own defense, gaslit me, offered help and withdrawn it, body shamed me about a million different times, emotionally abused me, told me I was dangerous for reporting attempts of others to hurt me, lied about my behavior in the pursuit of petty grudges, encouraged dangerous women to girlboss by destroying other people, punished me for reporting literal crimes, and discouraged friends from listening when I was suffering and desperately needed someone to talk to.


Feminist books are great. The PR is wonderful. Feminist people treat men like shit. The best of you are apathetic. The worst of you are vampires for whom the ability to hurt men is a perk. There is zero policing against abusive women who use the movement as a source of justifications for hurting others, you simply deny it ever happens instead.


Women who are dangerous people target those who are vulnerable who others will not believe or care about if they report wrongdoing.

bulbasauuuur,,,"Well I’m glad to hear he’s getting treatment. That early in treatment is still tough though. 

The issue is being gentle isn’t really what is best for either of you. Being assertive about how you feel is still important, and you can be understanding without babying him. I would think more it’s just like messages saying you’re thinking of him and hope he’s doing well without the expectation of a reply. This is assuming you communicate other ways besides text, too. Texting might be harder than other ways. If this texting is the only way you communicate, the issue would be a lot different.

A lot of people are jumping to weird conclusions about cheating and that he doesn’t care about you. They literally know nothing about him except a couple of texts, so don’t listen to all that since you know your relationship far better.

I also saw you say he tries to appease his dad because of how his dad treated him growing up. I honestly relate a lot with your boyfriend, except I’m a woman and it was with my mom, and I even had times where my depression was too overwhelming to talk to the people I loved most.  Does he have a plan to move out of his dad’s house? I’ve been in treatment for my mental illnesses for nearly 2 decades now but nothing improved my life as much as moving out of my mom’s house did. I highly encourage he take that step sooner rather than later. I assume money is an issue, but seriously, it’s worth figuring it out. It’s worth it to have a less comfortable physical space and not have the mental strain of a parent like that. It is freeing in a way I never could’ve imagined. I’d rather eat nothing but ramen noodles because that’s all I can afford than live with my mom again. 

The thing about a relationship is it can’t always be 50/50. Sometimes one person will need more support and can’t offer support. Sometimes it will switch. As long as the overall balance feels 50/50 then it still is fair. I really appreciate the people in my life that stuck with me through my worst periods of depression. Now that I’m able, I support them, help them, and am active in maintaining the relationships. I know how it can feel bad for the person who is trying to stick with someone with a mental illness and how it can feel like they don’t care about you at times, though. I know how my depression hurt people in my life too. But really, if someone was sick with cancer or something, no one would expect they’d be up for texting constantly. Bipolar disorder can be deadly and just as draining. 

So yeah, I guess I would say your feelings definitely do matter but I would consider the overall relationship more than this one incident. Consider if he put in effort when he could other times, or try to get through this now and see how his behavior is as he starts recovery

The sort of man, who'll put you in a hole financially with no remorse! A ""nice guy"", who only does the barest minimum around the house to complete a transaction for sex! Now he's using his ASD diagnosis as a deflective shield to excuse even more flagrantly disrespectful behavior, on purpose! When are you going to get angry on your own behalf and decide that you deserve better than to be treated like a single mother in a married household and a hole for him to fuck? Jesus, the vast majority of autistic people beat themselves up for the most minor social faux pas, and here this guy is, treating you not as a person he loves, but as a wife appliance, who isn't putting out enough for his liking. Are you kidding me? No diagnosis is going to excuse this man's actions. Stop trying to find excuses that removes his agency in what he's doing to you and own the fact that he's acting like this, because he can and likes it. He doesn't care about you. He cares about what you do for him. Your feelings, your boundaries, your agency and worth as a person comes second to whatever he wants, and he'll assert control in any way he can, to keep making you feeling small and guilty for not ""doing enough"" to please him. Don't fall for the bullshit coming out of his mouth, and look at his actions. Are you going to waste more time being treated like this, and join the statistic of married women dying younger than single women, while your husband joins the one of married men living longer than single ones? Why the fuck are you wasting your love on someone, who doesn't even give a fraction of that energy in return? Why would you fuck a man you're basically raising like a dependent? Quit burning yourself out for the sake of someone, who'll absolutely leave you, if you ever come down with burnout, cancer, or a crippling injury.

Past-Reading1157,,,"It would be helpful if you would say what city and country you live in. Many people here would be willing to help you look for resources that may be available to help your dog.  Do not shave your dogs fur- the fur doesn’t “take” nutrients- in fact a body will naturally let hair and skin suffer and go without in order to provide nutrients to systems that are critical to staying alive- like the heart, lungs and digestive system. Shaving its fur will only make it vulnerable- you said it is hot there- many dogs have double coats specifically to insulate them from cold AND heat and shaving them will make them unable to regulate their body temperature. 

Your dog may have something as minor as parasites or as serious as cancer- but it absolutely must have veterinary treatment or it will almost definitely die. Again, if you tell us where you live, people will help you find a way to treat the dog. 

Veterinary treatment costs money, because like doctors, vets have to go to medical school, and it takes years of training and a lot of money. What your parents may think is extortion is simply the cost it takes to get that training couple with what it takes to run a business and profit enough to survive most likely. And vets are not psychic- they cannot tell what is wrong with an animal without doing tests- they can only guess. 

People in many countries will go into debt in order to provide their dogs with medical care, so it is difficult to hear that your parents, who are not even struggling financially, simply do not want to use their money to help this dog. I understand there are probably cultural differences, but it is obvious that YOU love the dog so clearly caring enough to spend money on an animal isn’t entirely unheard of there.

No this is a moral positive claim not a scientific one.  
You can't prove moral claims. 

No law currently exists that says ""laws don't need to apply equally to both sexes as long as the factor is biological and not social."" therefore your original assertion is false and can be disregarded. 

>I'm stating that the inequality comes about because if outside forces we can't control (biology) 

But we CAN make things equal in regard to how those issues are dealt with. That's the point. Let's go back to your examination example. ""Women should be able to get free breast examination for breast cancer and men for testicular cancer."" Women cannot get testicular cancer and men cannot get cervical cancer (I'm using this example because men can actually get breast cancer). We can't change that. It's not anybody's fault. 

What we can do is ensure BOTH sexes have the right to access medical when they need it and ensure BOTH sexes have the right to bodily integrity. Banning one sex from having bodily integrity and access to medical care because you don't like the outcome is discrimination. 

Stripping bodily integrity and medical access from women and only women if they have sex and fall pregnant IS discrimination. Do you know how to make it equal? Either don't strip those things from women or strip them from men as well.

Responsibility is not a magic, ""get out of jail free"" care PL can use to deny someone their human rights.

You haven't proved this at all. 

>That's what's happening in this hypothetical. It seems you agree we shouldn't let the other person off the hook until such a time the other person is able to hold responsibility as well, right?

In your hypothetical BOTH are being held accountable.

Also interesting that your only way of explaining this is to use criminal activity. People who have sex and fall pregnant aren't criminals deserving of punishment. 

>And I'll say this again when it's possible for men to hold the same biological responsibility in all for putting that into law till such a time I believe child support should start at conception.

In order for this to be equal, women would also be paying CS at conception.

Jag fick ett ”konsultuppdrag” för några år sedan att ta mig igenom den vetenskapliga litteraturen på medicinska indikationer för cannabis. Spoiler; den är svag. Riktigt svag. 

Viss evidens för smärta men biverkningarna (att vara bäng) tolereras sämre än dåsigheten, illamåendet, förstoppningen av opiater. Man måste förstå att en medicinsk patient vill vara smärtfri och välfungerande. Att Agda med spridd cancer vill spendera sista tiden hög som ett hus och samtidigt vara med barn och barnbarn. Nej. Det verkar inte fungera som en smärtmedicin. Att Liam vill röka holk för sin stukade fot istället för att äta naproxen. Ja det är lättare att förstå. 

Viss evidens för muskelspänningar vid MS. Men samma sak här. Biverkningarna är för svåra för att anses vara fördelaktiga sett till övriga alternativ.

Absolut ingen indikation vid Parkinsons sjukdom. Ett fåtal case reports där personer har rapporterat subjektiv förbättring men ingen som påvisats hos större populationer. 

Jag adresserar inte ruseffekten, skadeverkan jämfört med alkohol eller samhällsekonomiska konsekvenser här utan endast det medicinska. På den punkten är det däremot ett rätt tydligt nej. Det finns ingen tydlig medicinsk indikation för cannabis. Inte på populationsbasis.

Street_Hedgehog_9595,RomanCatholic,Roman Catholic,"Lemme ask you this. If someone came along and said I'd give you 1,000,000 dollars to avoid this sin, what would you do differently? Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.

I'm saying prioritizing parental rights over the child's best interest and well-being is abuse. 

For example you can't hit your kid. That's not allowed. You can't use the idea of parental rights and saying that you can do whatever you want to justify hitting your kid. 

Also even if there's a low risk it's still a good idea to get a vaccine because it helps protect those that cannot get the vaccine due to medical reasons because the more people who are vaccinated it means a more protected they are too so it really helps. some of these people have autoimmune deficiencies and so they have a harder time fighting off the virus which could end up being deadly for these people. 

Also there have actually been no confirmed cases of deaths by HPV vaccine and the majority of deaths about HPV have to do with the HPV itself.

Nothing about the current political situation we are currently experiencing in the west will ever make sense to you unless you first understand that you live under foreign occupation and are thus subject to the rules of the occupiers. If you do not start from there, you will search for multiple explanations and rationalizations for your society's misery and shortcomings that will ultimately lead you nowhere.


The thing is, your enemy has no interest in a so-called ""victory"" over you, because they already won - long ago, before most of you were even born. Now, the entirety of their actions is aimed at a single goal - humiliation. Humiliation robs you of your humanity, your will, your reason to fight on. Humiliation takes everything from you, and it even robs you of being worthy of empathy. It has been used by every occupier in history, and it’s our natural primal understanding of defeat.
The Ottoman practice of Köçek is a prime example, similar to the concept of “Drag Kids” in modern America. Köçeks were a combination of dancers, clowns and prostitutes; they were young non-Muslim boys taken from their parents and trained to be willful sexual objects and entertainers for the Ottoman Turks. The goal was to have the occupied think “if we allow that to be done to our boys, what else can they do?” The answer is ""anything"". It is full-spectrum domination of the minds of the conquered.


Your enemy doesn't want gay pride parades in your street, drag queens in your libraries, your son's penis mutilated and drip-fed estrogen from birth, your parents dead from opioids and cancer, your daughter race mixing, your meat replaced with bugs, all while your media laughs at you because they think it’s for anyone's benefit.

CrazyCartwheels,,,"Checking perplexity.io for the term: ""Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal"" 

Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal extranodal extension refers to a specific pathological finding in prostate cancer where the cancer cells have spread beyond the confines of a lymph node capsule. This finding is significant in the staging and prognosis of prostate cancer. Extranodal extension, also known as extracapsular extension, occurs when cancer cells breach the outer layer (capsule) of a lymph node and extend into the surrounding tissue. When this extension is described as ""focal,"" it indicates that the spread beyond the lymph node is limited in extent rather than widespread. The presence of extranodal extension is an important prognostic factor in prostate cancer. It typically indicates a more aggressive disease and is associated with a higher risk of cancer recurrence and poorer overall outcomes. This finding often influences treatment decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive therapeutic approaches. In the context of prostate cancer staging, the presence of focal extranodal extension would likely categorize the disease as at least stage III, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland to nearby tissues or lymph nodes. However, the exact staging would depend on other factors such as the number of positive lymph nodes and the presence of distant metastases. It's important to note that while focal extranodal extension is a concerning finding, it does not necessarily mean the cancer is incurable. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these approaches, depending on the overall extent of the disease and other individual patient factors.",0,1719829305,,,0,lb3uq8l,t3_1dso4rv,t3_1dso4rv,1719829321,3,False,ProstateCancer,t5_2s1qy
GoldfishChronicle,,,"This is related, but not the same. I hope it can help you anyways. I was the close friend/girlfriend (13 yrs) of a man with terminal colorectal cancer; my own father passed away in 2021 from prostate cancer. His son was in the final year of his degree when he was admitted to emergency surgery for removal of the blockage in his bowels, it was the first any one of us knew of his condition. We only knew he had been unwell but the doctors thought it might be colitis and they were still testing when things rapidly fell apart. 

Truth be told in the hospital, his son was in shock, so young to be confronted with such a situation. He was concerned with how he would balance his job, relationship and school. He looked like he wanted to run away, back to normalcy; I didn't blame him. But I admit to feeling a little frustrated, because of my own experience I know the guilt that arises after, despite the fact that I was with my own father every step of the way... I was worried he would regret his actions and words at that time. But I am not him, and he is not me, so held my tongue. He ended up completing his final year and graduating. His father passed away just weeks before graduation. He made it to say goodbye.

While my loved one was sick, he would save his energy to mask his pain and worries in front of his son. After recovering from the first surgery, I told him, he should reserve his time for his son, he needed to rely on his son, his son needed to feel needed, to know that he helped in a meaningful way, or else he might pay the price later on. Not quit school, but to be confided in, or asked to help every so often. Not fully sheltered. I don't know if he took the information to heart. 

What I do know is this: You could have been in the same room as your mother, day in and day out and still feel guilty. The brain looks for the cause, it wants to know how to avoid the pain again, it wants the source. It will play tricks on you, having you rethink things over and over again. A child is meant to diverge from the path of their parent at some point, lead their own life, separate, but together in spirit. They didn't want to break your path, ""even if I cannot go forward, they can"". This was her wish, she didn't want you to suffer then, even though she can't save you from it now. That was her choice, you can be angry if you don't like it, because valuable information was withheld from you. That is fair. 

Your path was meant to move away from them at some point, the death feels very different when your path was tied to walking with the departed as a life partner; be gentle with your father. You lost the same person, but you are grieving different relationships. You can tell him you don't want to be kept in the dark ever again, and tell him how it has affected you when you are both ready. Anger is normal, it will pass. You will want to fight something, anyone, anything, when you are not reconciled to what has happened. (I am guilty of this too.)

Your mother set out to protect you for as long as possible... She did her job. You did what she wanted you to do. Over time forgive yourself, and just know she loved you very much. She was probably content with you out of the storm and yet worried for you all at once. Be angry, be sad, feel guilty, feel numb, but do not despair. Do not lose hope or the courage to move forward later, when you slowly regain your strength. She did not want you to stagnate, do not forsake her wish. Be an example for your father, he will be lonely, let him know you still have each other. Let him know you still want him to witness your accomplishments and want him there to tell you he is proud. Let him know there is still life after loss, even if it doesn't feel that there will be ever again. It probably feels really unfair that he is almost making you be the strong one. Let the adult part of you listen carefully to your inner child who is rampaging and inconsolable right now. Don't admonish them, they've just suffered a catastrophic loss, their whole world is changed, be soft with them, let them have a few free passes, one day, the tears will be less and less frequent. Life will be different, but the sun will come out again.

Be kind to yourself, this hurt takes time to scar over. Don't rush, be patient. You will heal. (I'm so sorry this is so long, I am grieving too and I tend to ramble when I am sad and introspective.)",0,1719829348,,,0,lb3usm9,t3_1dsogs2,t3_1dsogs2,1719829365,4,False,grief,t5_2s369

theipaper,,Verified Media Outlet,"In response to the report, the Government said it was making tackling ransomware a priority in an effort to raise the cyber resilience of the UK, and its critical national infrastructure. It pledged further investment and to work with industry and international partners to pursue criminal groups who conduct attacks.

The Government claims to have spent over £338m on increasing the resilience of NHS systems to protect it from hacks, and in 2023 launched the UK’s Cyber Strategy to set minimum standards of cyber security to help defend critical infrastructure.

In the recent NHS hack, Qilin, which has been held responsible and has a record of attempting to extort money, stole information covering 300 million patient interactions, including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer. The attack led to the cancellation of more than 1,000 operations and 2,000 appointments.

The group later published a tranche of highly sensitive NHS records into the public domain last Friday, after failing to receive a ransom payment.

Following a detailed security briefing with European investigators, and interviews with UK sources, i revealed on Wednesday that Qilin is merely one arm of a much wider web of hacking affiliates, using servers based in Russia to carry out attacks on UK critical infrastructure.

Hackers enjoy safe haven in Russia, from where they carry out ransomware attacks, so long as they do not cross red lines or cause too much diplomatic uproar, i has been told. And the recent attack on the NHS has been seen as a “major escalation” of the Kremlin’s use of cyber warfare, according to investigators, whose work i was given exclusive access to.

Internal messages between the Russian hackers, seen by i, show them asking a higher authority from the group’s leadership for permission to attack specific targets in the UK on previous occasions.

Until June, attacks on other nation’s healthcare services which could potentially lead to casualties were seen as “off limits” by the Kremlin. But the assault on NHS provider Synnovis on 3 June represents a loosening of the reins, leading to national security concerns among Western intelligence agencies.

Three UK sources warned that the country could face more attacks on critical national infrastructure which could disrupt services, meddle with democracy, and threaten lives.

“The Kremlin has lifted a block on UK targets it once thought were a step too far,” a UK intelligence source told i. “I expect we will see a drastic rise in cyber attacks to critical services over the next 12 months.”

Another called the attack a “significant escalation” which challenges the definition of an “act of war”.

In a detailed security briefing with i, investigators from Prodaft – a privately funded cyber crime firm partnering with official organisations including Europol, the FBI, and NCA – warned that action against Qilin without looking at the wider hacking network would be “insignificant”.

Prodaft is part of Europol’s EC3 partner framework, which works with international law enforcement agencies as part of a coalition of specialist researchers, focused on unmasking some of the world’s most notorious cybercrime groups.

EC3 is an EU taskforce to help protect nations against cyber crime of all types, and continues to work with UK agencies after Brexit.",0,1719829715,,,0,lb3vcpz,t3_1dspo39,t1_lb3vbit,1719829731,2,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb

She’s close to a decade older than me. One of my faults is being too emotional at times so she always had the ‘emotional’ upper hand.

My parents provided her with a lot, financially, emotionally and with childcare. Her partner of 15 years has never provided and refused to get up in the mornings to look after the kids while she went to college. My dad stepped up with this years ago and took over both school runs while he slept all day. He has also told her he won’t stop taking drugs bcos she’s fat and didn’t lose weight. He’s physically assaulted me and my sister many moons ago. He called my mother and father smelly just to name a few things. Over the years, I’ve offered her money for a place, I’ve offered support, I’ve begged her to see her worth but after 15 years I can’t keep listening to how much she hates someone that she clearly loves and wants around. 

My mother passed after a horrific cancer battle when my son was 8 months old and I’ve felt like my sister hasn’t been there at all. I’ve really struggled mentally becoming a mother while grieving my own I guess.

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

Please don't write GUIs in C++ in 2024.

Why?

I can see why single-file is convenient, but 40 MiB is a silly requirement these days, especially if you're also shipping the UI framework.

>Writing the GUI part of the program should not take more time than the actual functionality

Writing the GUI part of the program _is_ a big part ""the actual functionality"".

> The .NET framework comes preinstalled on Windows 10+, so we would technically still meet the no dependencies criteria. The issue is that with bundling the .dll, it would still mean it being extracted somewhere and writing additional code for the P/Invoke to work, and C++/CLI gets compiled to .NET IL code

There's zero context on why there needs to be an underlying DLL written in C++. I'm going to assume you're reticulating some splines or trying to cure cancer.

But if you _do_ need that, you still probably shouldn't target .NET Framework. It's old. Instead, target .NET 8, and publish to be largely self-contained. Don't use C++/CLI.

I (F26) am on a 14-day birthday trip with my friend (F30) for her 30th birthday in Europe. We have traveled to multiple countries, with our last country being Sweden because she said it was cheaper for her to fly home from Sweden than our actual last destination (Spain). I am the only friend of hers that decided to come on this trip. 

While in Spain, I got a call from my family back in the US that my grandma wants to stop her cancer treatment and will probably pass before the end of July. I am distraught, but I wanted to finish this trip out fully since I couldn’t change my flight home to be earlier (only 3 more days), and for my friend. 

My friend has frequently done things on our vacation that have made me feel crappy and made it difficult to travel with her, such as telling me within our first 2 days that she finds many of the things I do annoying. 

She went out last night with a friend who was in the area, and I stayed in because my family had just rushed my grandma to the hospital for the 2nd time the past few days. She came back after midnight, and told me that she was going to move her flight to Sweden to land at 7pm, instead of the flight we booked together to leave at 10am to land at noon so that she could sleep in.  

We are only in Sweden for 2 days, and her landing at 7 basically puts the first day as a wash. I’m fine with solo-traveling, but with the news, this isn’t a time I wanted to be alone. I told her that I was shocked that she would move her flight not only without asking me about it, leaving me to take our original flight alone, but with the news I just got about my grandma, it would never cross my mind to leave a friend alone during this time just to sleep in, especially if they flew all the way to Europe for my birthday trip. 

I brought it up to her, and she doubled down and got upset at me for not wanted her to prioritize her wellbeing and for expecting her, in her eyes, to ask me for permission to change her flight. 

AITA?

alaMICUdRg,,Mare cu dă toate,"> Romani 1:20 BVA. Perceperea existenței divine | însușiri invizibile

Afirmație mistică și, de altfel, nonsensică. 

> Cum de totul functioneaza asa perfect? Corpul uman si corpul tuturor vietatilor ?

Bună întrebare. Răspunsul e că nu funcționează perfect. De ce? Există prea multe motive, dar printre ele:

Cancerele: mutații maligne produse de propriul corp, fie aleatoriu, fie ca răspuns la factori externi (poți face cancer și trăind în cele mai sănătoase medii și mâncând doar chestii sănătoase), care nu discriminează după credință, etnie, moralitate și nici măcar după vârstă (vezi cazuri de copii la vârste foarte fragede care suferă/mor de leucemie. Și lasă-mă cu ”îi testează dumnezeu”, că-i o afirmație bolnavă și lipsită de empatie). 

Nervul laringian: Nerv important în controlarea corzilor vocale care pleacă de la creier, trece prin jurul inimii (sunt siiigur că aici o să găsești o semnificație mistică :)) ), ca apoi să se întoarcă la gât. Să zicem că asta nu-i așa mare problemă la oameni, că nu e mare ocolul, dar știi la ce e ridicol? La girafe, unde se întâmplă fix același lucru, însă acolo distanțele sunt... considerabil mai mari. Halal design inteligent, dacă mă întrebi pe mine. Nu e la fel de grav precum cancerul sau următorul exemplu, dar mi se pare mult mai probabil ca acest defect să fi apărut prin evoluție și să nu fi fost înlăturat prin selecție naturală tocmai pentru că nu afectează în mod semnificativ sănătatea.

Bolile autoimune: Pentru că s-a gândit dumnezeu să facă sistemele imunitare ale unor oameni să le atace propriile corpuri până la moarte, nu? De plictiseală, nu? Merită să-l preaslăvesc pe dumnezeu, nu?

”pielea de găină”: o chestie pe care o face corpul cu diferite scopuri (intimidare, control al temperaturii interne), dar care, în lipsa blănii, nu face absolut nimic. Foarte bun design, ce să zic...

Honorable mentions, care nu necesită explicație: apendicele, măselele de minte, coccisul, sfârcurile la bărbați, hipermetropia și miopia(asta mă omoară în mod special pe mine), etc., ai prins ideea. Sper.

>  cum de ea este singura din Calea Lactee care poate sa sustina viata in forma asta ?

Is that a fact? N-avem încă uneltele necesare să măsurăm cu acuratețe foarte mare decât planete din relativa vecinătate (în contextul cosmic). Și Calea Lactee are aprox 100.000 de ani lumină în diametru, e foarte posibil ca ce vedem noi în partea cealaltă a galaxiei să fie... old news, ca să zic așa. 

> Cum au aparut toate ? Din nimic nu se poate, trebuie sa existe ceva pt a se putea crea altceva.

Unu la mână, dacă e valabilă afirmația ta, de ce e excepție de la regulă dumnezeu? Doi la mână, doar pentru că nu poți concepe ceva, nu înseamnă că răspunsul e automat unul divin. Trei la mână, ai destule teorii ale începutului universului. N-ai nevoie de diplome în fizică să le înțelegi, poți fi și la nivel de amator (ca mine) să înțelegi de ce unele sunt mai probabile decât altele, de ce anumite descoperiri au invalidat unele teorii. Patru, știința, într-adevăr, vine cu teorii, unele mai probabile decât altele, dar nu are orgoliul de a spune ”asta-i explicația”, cum o fac credincioșii. Amintește-mi, orgoliul/mândia, nu era un păcat capital?

Deci îmi pot răspunde cu precizie la întrebările despre natura universului și a existenței niște locuitori din deșertul oriental-mijlociu de acum 2000 de ani? Ok...

> insa crestinismul prezinta un Dumnezeu care se aproprie de om si chiar ajunge pe pamant intrupat

Dovada? Așa cred și eu în Harry Potter pentru că am citit nu una, ci șapte cărți despre el. Nu ai cum să dovedești că biblia nu e o născocire mega-modificată de-a lungul timpului, fără să intri în erori logice (de ce crezi în dumnezeu? Că așa zice biblia. De ce crezi biblia? Că e scrisă de dumnezeu prin intermediari. Cine zice? Biblia. Asta-i logică circulară)

> Isaia 57:15, despre iad, Matei 25:41

Ok...? Cum am zis, când nu merge cu logică, se apelează la emoție (în speță, frică. Am de comentat și aici despre cum frica e incompatibilă cu iubirea și religiile care îți încearcă toate emoțiile pentru a te prinde în ele). La mine nu mai merge.

Am făcut asta, în repetate rânduri. Fie că mă crezi sau nu, am pornit de la a fi credincios. Una din laturile familiei este destul de religioasă (cu mers în fiecare duminică la biserică, de la mic la mare), iar tranziția către ateism n-a fost peste noapte, deci ar fi avut destule ocazii să mă readucă pe drumul ”cel drept”, dacă voia/exista.

Iar prin procesul ăsta de îndoială am ajuns la concluzia că religia e răspunsul cel mai simplu/leneș pentru întrebările existențiale și/sau chiar normale ale vieții, ”e voia domnului”.

I sure do miss doing that.
Been castrated for 6 years.
Original goal was just to destroy testosterone, which did work, but after balls got small and hard, Dr exam for testicular cancer resulted in an ultrasound and referral to urologist.

Although no cancer was detected on ultrasound, I was having some aching in my balls that was very annoying.

Urologist recommended removing them just to make sure there was no cancer.

Since no cancer was initially detected on ultrasound an inguinal incision to remove my balls was not done and they were removed via a scrotal incision.

Pathology exam thankfully revealed no cancer.

So, while stirring and alcohol injections did destroy my balls and eliminated testosterone, the original objective, it ultimately resulted in castration, not the original or desired goal.

So now with no balls, I miss them, but have found that there are many advantages to not having them.

Specialist doctors generally charge about $800 pesos for an exam and diagnostics, and medicines are also very inexpensive. Unless you have cancer or a complicated medical condition, it's usually feasible to pay for services out of pocket. However, insurance is still recommended for emergencies and future medical needs.

Private insurance is the best option. My wife and I are in our 50s, and I just renewed our policy, paying $92,000 pesos for the year with a $31,000 deductible and 10% copay per condition (no deductible for emergencies/accidents). This policy also includes $100,000 USD coverage outside of Mexico.

Here's a passage where he speaks to the coherence and importance of the notion (p. 57):

>What seems clear however is that, firstly, viewed through a macro-lens our world appears to be probabilistic and, secondly, in light of the fact that probabilistic theories prevail at every level all the way down to QM, it’s doubtful whether, even if we knew enough of the fine details of the universe, we’d be able to uncover sufficient (or indeed necessary) causes for each effect.

>To illustrate, consider the causal relation between asbestos inhalation and mesothelioma. The process by which the former brings about the latter is complex, and there isn’t yet consensus on the details. But one study suggests the following. Asbestos is toxic to human mesothelial cells (which line the pleural cavities in the lungs). The damage that asbestos fibres do to these cells results in the protein HMGB1 being released from them. The presence of extracellular HMGB1 leads macrophages (a type of white blood cell) to release another protein, TNF-A. TNF-A activates NF-kB in damaged mesothelial cells. Activated NF-kB helps some of these damaged cells to survive. These damaged cells can then develop into cancer cells.

>Assume that some picture like this is right. Then, even in the case of an individual person, the causal process by which asbestos exposure can bring about mesothelioma is probabilistic. It depends, for instance, upon the ‘random walks’ followed by asbestos fibres experiencing Brownian motion in the air and in the lungs. It depends upon the probabilistic process of osmosis (of HMGB1 and TNF-A), which comes under the purview of statistical mechanics. And it depends upon molecular bonding processes (which are involved in the stimulation of macrophages by HMGB1, and in the activation of NF-kB by TNF-A), which are subject to QM probabilities.

Hello. To the people who have been on this situation and to people who are on the opposite side. I need your input.

A family member has cancer and is currently undergoing chemo. Due to the severity, we had no choice but to avail the services of a private hospital. As expected, the cost of treatment for each session is expensive. We found that there are agencies that could give financial aid, some of which needs for the recipient to be treated in a public hospital.

During the initial checkup from the oncologist, we have already stated that we ARE going to transfer to a cheaper hospital(public). But time and again the doctor has made ways to delay, such as witholding information, for us to plan our relocation,. We called public hospitals and asked the requirements so that we could find a new oncologist. One requirement is we need to have a transfer letter from our current oncologist.

Before the latest treatment, we had an appointment with the oncologist and stated that we need the transfer letter. They did not agree and we weren't able to get the transfer letter. He made excuses like we can still avail financial aid and use it on the private hospital. Our family is not rich, and we are only able to afford it because of financial help from generous relatives and friends.

I need help on the following:
1. How to be able to get the transfer letter or persuade the doctor?
2. I would like to understand why the oncologist doesn't want us to relocate.
3. Is the doctor allowed to deny our request to transfer?

South-Host8293,,,"Small correction: the new population is a tiny bit over 2.4 million 🙂

Here is the current situation in Albania:

1. A scandal broke out at the cancer department of the country's main hospital, where surgeons and nurses were administering reduced cures to cancer patients and sold the remainder at pharmacies, which would charge crazy prices for the same cures. They also ignored treatment unless they were bribed by the patients' relatives.

2. The justice system of the country had 30-40% (can be checked online) of its judges and prosecutors fired over corruption. The decisions have been dubious. The current ones still at work are way too overloaded and can't manage the influx of cases.
Meanwhile, the lists of newly appointed judges and prosecutors are updated with tens of new names despite those not winning the magistrate exam.

3. In the education system, the principal and a few teachers of one of the main high schools (sometimes considered in the top 3) was charged with fraud because she PROMISED STUDENTS she'd get them to top US universities. The US Embassy had to make the case public to get the authorities moving.

What does this mean for an average Albanian (or TL:DR):

1. Your grandfather or sick relative may die in the hospital from maltreatment if you don't bribe his doctor.

2. If you end up in court there's a good chance your case will be ignored, or ruled by an incompetent or corrupt (or both) judge. In short, whethere you're right or wrong, you have to buy your freedom just in case.

3. Your kids, even if they are in a top school, may be defrauded by their politically appointed principal. Not to mention th universities which basically perform zero research, only teaching.

These are public stories, but there are millions of silent stories nobody publicizes. Now you can imagine why half a million Albanians left their country in one decade. It's an unliveable place.

In Albania the solution is impossible without politics. You need a strong, organized political group, with no ties to the establishment, to win elections despite vote buying and fraud, to uproot every single sector from the top, especially health, education and justice.

And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't!

tweetysvoice,,,"For an Aquatic Veterinarian, It’s Never ‘Just a Fish’
The New York Times · by Emily Anthes


Many students begin veterinary school with career aspirations that date back to childhood, when they fell in love with the idea of ministering to cats and dogs, or horses, or the exotic animals at the zoo. Jessie Sanders arrived at veterinary school with a more particular passion. “I was the one weird fish kid,” she said.

It was an interest that had surprised even her. In college, Dr. Sanders had started volunteering at an aquarium, hoping to work with the whales. Instead, she found herself assigned to the fish team — and falling hard for her finned charges.

“I just love fish,” she said. “I love the way they’re built. I love the way they interact with the environment. And there’s still so much that we just don’t know about all the little internal workings.”

Today, Dr. Sanders runs Aquatic Veterinary Services, with patients that include carnival goldfish, pet store bettas and prizewinning koi worth tens of thousands of dollars. Last year, she became one of the first 10 veterinarians to receive a board certification in fish practice, a wholly new accreditation.

Dr. Sanders spoke with The New York Times about life as a fish veterinarian. Her story was based on two conversations, and her responses were edited and condensed.

I’ve done nothing but pet fish for 10 years, and it’s been awesome and challenging. I like the challenge of setting everything in an underwater environment. And the amount of personalities that you get in fish — they have so many little quirks. Some of them are super chill and nice, and some of them are complete terrors.

We had a hospital for about three years. Unfortunately, a 24-hour gym moved in and shared the adjacent wall, and they liked to play their music all night long. Fish have an organ known as a lateral line that picks up on vibrations; it’s how they’re able to sense predators, swim in a school together. Obviously, having rock music played at you all hours in the night is very stressful. Anything connected to that wall we lost within the first month they opened.

We just have a mobile practice now. We serve the greater San Francisco Bay Area. I’ll drive from three to eight hours in a day. When I get there, it’s the same as you taking your cat or your dog to the vet. We’ll have a discussion: What’s been going on? Have they been eating? Is there anything in particular that you want me to take a really close look at?

The most common “disease” that we see in fish is actually poor water chemistry. Like the air that we breathe, the water that a fish swims in is critical to their overall health. If you’re breathing in nothing but pollution, you’re going to be prone to more illnesses. So we check the water chemistry; if it’s terrible, the fish are already stressed out. I don’t want to put hands on them because that could make things worse.

Then you’ve got to catch the fish. I have a bunch of different nets. The cute little square aquarium nets for tank fish — I usually use one on each side of the fish and kind of squish ’em together. In bigger ponds, I use seine nets. They have floats on the top and weights on the bottom. I have ponds that are so big that I have to use two nets and get in there with my waders. It’s one of those things you’ve got to practice. No one’s good when they start out, but I’m really good at it now.

After I catch them, they’ll be transferred to the exam tub. I usually have a tub of their tank or their pond water that is ready to go with some sedatives. For most of my physical exams, I prefer that the fish be lightly anesthetized. It’s less stress for them; trying to restrain a wet, slippery torpedo is not really going to be in either of our favors. We just need them to be handleable. So they might be wiggling a fin at me, but once they’re anesthetized, I can get a really good look all around their body.

Usually we’re going to do skin mucus and gill biopsies. The skin mucus biopsy is mostly just looking for parasites, which can irritate fish and make them lethargic. The gill biopsies are more important because that can show us what their respiratory system is doing. It provides us a great diagnostic tool without having to stick a tube down their throat.

If we need to do any more diagnostics, ultrasound or radiographs, we can do that while the fish is asleep. One client has a pond of goldfish, and there’s one goldfish that just hasn’t been able to get up and swim with everybody; she’s kind of stuck on the bottom. We’re going to take X-rays.

A buoyancy disorder is when a fish that should be able to swim in the middle of the water column is either sinking to the bottom or floating to the surface. It’s very important for fish with buoyancy disorders that we can evaluate their internal anatomy — specifically their swim bladder, a little air sac that helps them float.

It can be diet related, too. This is very common in goldfish ponds, where you have fish that float after eating. If there’s a lot of competition and limited food during feeding time, it’s madness. They’re all just eating, eating, eating; they suck down a little bit too much air.

That can be corrected by spreading out the feeding a little bit more or feeding a sinking diet. A lot of fish diets float because it gives owners the opportunity to evaluate them at the surface, and obviously it’s a lot more interactive. Koi and goldfish are naturally bottom-feeding fish. But we have taught them — because they’re golden retrievers, they’ll do anything for food — to come to the surface during feeding time.

For fish surgeries, there’s many different levels. I do a lot of enucleations, which is eyeball removals. In fish, these are so easy; they don’t have eyelids or need to have any sort of globe in there to look normal. I did one for a little goldfish that actually had an abscess in her eye. The fish was just utterly miserable. We were able to get that out, and the next day the owner is, like, “She’s a completely different fish. She’s eating, she’s zipping around.” They heal up just beautifully every single time.

We see ovarian cancer very commonly in koi. If we catch it early enough, we can do surgery to remove it. We use a higher dose of the sedative. We have a specialized trough that the fish sits upright in. They sit over a little reservoir that has the anesthetized water. There is an aquarium pump that pumps it through a tube up into the fish’s mouth, it goes over their gills, runs down the side of their body and then back to the reservoir.

The biggest challenge is the public not even knowing that fish veterinarians exist. Even within our own profession, we’re ridiculed. Fish aren’t respected as pets in general. Like, “Why are you wasting your time? It’s just a fish.” For a lot of people, it’s not just a fish. It’s an actual living and breathing animal that needs to have care and respect. A lot of fish are taken into homes as practice pets and get the really short end of the stick.",0,1719792462,,,0,lb1zp67,t3_1dsfh2z,t3_1dsfh2z,1719792477,11,False,aquarium,t5_2rf28

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that  the doctors who have no  interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.  With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list  and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.  It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.  The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.  The LDN tablets she was taking  were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.  Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.  My own medical cabinet is quite empty now! 



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and  residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.

successiseffort,,,"""When Dr. Fauci became head of NIAID, azidothymidine, known as AZT, was the only candidate as an AIDS remedy. AZT is a “DNA chain terminator,” randomly destroying DNA synthesis in reproducing cells. It had been developed in 1964 for cancer, but abandoned as too toxic even for short-term therapy. It was deemed so worthless that it was not even patented. In 1985, Samuel Broder, head of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), claimed having found that AZT killed HIV in test tubes. The British company Burroughs Wellcome then patented it as an AIDS remedy. “Recognizing financial opportunity in the desperate terror of young AIDS patients facing certain death, the drug company set the price at up to $10,000/year per patient—making AZT one of the most expensive drugs in pharmaceutical history. Since Burroughs Wellcome could manufacture AZT for pennies per dose, the company anticipated a bonanza.”


""Wellcome research teams had engaged in widespread data tampering. More than half of the AZT patients suffered adverse reactions so deadly that they needed multiple blood transfusions just to keep them alive. Nevertheless, Fauci kept on lying himself to the top of the world, with little scrutiny from mainstream media.""

According to Dr. Claus Köhnlein, a German oncologist, “We virtually killed a whole generation of AIDS patients without even noticing it because the symptoms of the AZT intoxication were almost indistinguishable from AIDS.”

Dijon2017,,,"I’m sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient’s and cancer’s responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It’s not clear how “the nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit”. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an “aggressive” type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient’s subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient’s cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it’s entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother’s complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

My mom's family had a big fight about 15 years ago because of an inheritance. The main fight was between my mom and dad on the one hand, and my aunts Lorna and Missy on the other hand. The specific cause of the fight is not relevant to this post, but had something to do with pieces of land that were given to some family members before my grandmother's passing and how to count their value. After this fight, a few attempts for reconciliation were made, to no avail. This was all more than 10 years ago. There was no contact with Lorna or Missy ever since. My other aunts Ally, Maeve and Ginny never took a side and are still in touch with both 'parts' of the family.

Five years ago, my mother passed away after she had cancer for 6 months. Lorna and Missy never contacted her while she was ill, but did visit her in the hospital during her last week (when she was not lucid anymore). They did come to the funeral, but did not speak to me. I found it very sad that they never made up while my mom was still alive. We have not been in touch since. 

Now, one of Lorna's daughters organises a BBQ and invited the whole family, including us. I was unsure whether to go, since I got a baby 5 weeks ago and it might be too busy for the baby. I also don't want to leave my baby alone yet.  However, I wanted to go as I saw it as an attempt for reconciliation. 

After a talk to my dad, I decided not to go. He pointed out that none of the estranged family members have congratulated me for the birth of the baby. Also, they have never apologised or said their regrets for not making up while my mom was still alive. He made it clear that it would hurt him if I would go to this party, because I would prioritise the estranged family over seeing him more frequently after having the baby. I do see him once a week, but he would like that to be more often. 

Now, I want to skip the party to not hurt my dad. Would I be the asshole to my estranged family?

3nderslime,,,"Basically : it’s impossible for the politicians to keep up to date on all the subject they legislate on, or to pass laws that are consistently up to date and specific enough to effectively regulate industries. This is why we have agencies, like the FDA, FAA, OSHA, etc. so that Congress can pass more broad and ""vague"" laws, such as ""don’t put carcinogenics in food"", while the agencies, who are staffed by scientists , lawyers and other experts in their fields can decide on the definitions of carcinogenics, classifying which substances are carcinogenics, determining how to test for carcinogenics in foods, and enforce the law, etc.

Agencies are important because they are a lot more flexible and a lot less restrained than Congress is, which allows them to react very quickly to new developments in their specific field of competence, and because they are compromised of people who have a lot of experience in specific fields, unlike politicians who need to have a broader understanding of as many subjects as possible.

However, they are criticized for the little oversight elected officials have on them, and many people perceive them to be self serving.

Under chevron, courts had to defer to the agencies expertise when it came to interpreting the law, as long as said interpretation was judged reasonable. That made it very hard for corporations to contest fines or orders made to them from those agencies.

Now, with chevron overturned, corporations will be able to take agencies to court over the regulations imposed by agencies, and it will be up to the juges to determine whether or not to enforce the regulations.

For example, imagine a generic beer manufacturer invents a new compound, lets call it Betamine, that allows to make processing the beer 5c cheaper for each can they sell. However, after testing, the FDA finds that ingesting betamine has a high chance of causing cancer when ingested, and that beer manufacturer's processes leaves a lot of Betamine in the final product.

Under Chevron, the FDA was free to ban the usage of Betamine in beer manufacturing, and there would be little else for beer manufacturer to do but comply, as they would have very little legal standing to contest the new regulation.

But now, with Chevron gone, beer manufacturer would be free to sue the FDA, and could argue in court that Betamine was never mentioned by the ""don’t put carcinogenics in food"" law, nor was it ever classified as a carcinogenic before the FDA's new regulation, and there it is perfectly legal to put Betamine in food, and also is beer even a food product in the first place?


And if a court was to rule in beer manufacturer's favor, there would be very little the FDA could do to stop them from putting Betamine in beer, or any other corporation under their jurisdiction for that matter.",0,1719794769,,,0,lb25apj,t3_1dqkviv,t1_laowd3x,1719794787,1,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63

Telomeres, the guards of your DNA... Science's not secret dirty secret

What are Telomeres? they are chromosomal proteins that cap off the ends of your double helix.

Ok why do i care about them? they are part of the reason you die, directly effect cellular degeneration. Which is why we die, doesnt actually have to be that way though... everytime your cells multiply they become a bit less, this is also how cancer forms, in a way...

what does that have to do with the Annunaki? Genetic manipulation, a ""man made"" change has been done to this structure, twice just on the end.
1 of which you might not notice if you are already deep in it, also known as the God Gene/worship gene, Scientifically known as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 or VMAT2. it is the reason why people are so attuned to following, religious beliefs and religious experiences, submissivness. The theory is that ancient other wordly travelers used the same genetic manipulation that we have learned today to make us more acceptable to rule, obediant, etc. Also like i mentioned lifespan, now limited to 100-120 years from what it was said to be which is closer to 125000-250000 years as the Annunaki were said to have lived. They made us weaker, more susceptible to illness, pain, fatigue, etc.  Im sure i dont need to say that these changes are not natural and not evolution, thatd be the opposite of it.... tortoises live longer than you...just to name one... a turtle dude... they can live to 150 easy ...SMH 😆 i continue anyway

So only 7% (exact number) of our DNA is unique to humans, just 1.5% is unique to our species and shared with everyone. Where did any other bits come from if not evolution..?

What this all suggests is the missin link isnt the ""God of the Gaps"" its Ultrahuman intervention.
Someone did something and we are looking at the result, most simply said. Call them Aliens, call them ancient travelers, call them Annunaki, doesnt matter... only point is Someone with the same and furher knowledge of biological and genetic science did something and we are perceiving it. the work just isnt signed with a written work up so we know the process.

Able-Contest-9147,,,"Your comment resonates with me. I just had to leave a 9 year relationship, he had been cheating both emotionally and physically with random people throughout our entire relationship, even during my breast cancer treatment (though I’ve learned that’s not rare). I stayed for almost a year and a half after I forgave what I initially found and what he initially told me. But he trickle-truthed, I kept on finding out about more and more stuff he’d done. But we were very much codependent on each other, and I stayed way longer than was healthy for me. 

Now I’m feeling that same codependency pull, I still want to make sure he has his meds and is remembering his lunch for work, etc etc. (I did way more for him than I should have.) And I want to know that he’s well but I’m trying so hard to avoid contact. I wish I could have my memories erased, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind style. (I just hope I wouldn’t find my ex again, heh.)

And I want to know why, why he did all those things, why he hurt me, why he didn’t speak up if he was unhappy. Why he said “fuck yes” when I asked him to marry me up on stage at a friend’s concert. I asked him to marry me in front of so many people, I wonder why he let me embarrass myself, too. And just why why why everything. I also feel like I’m perpetually damaged. I was numb for a while but now I can’t get through my day without crying. 

I think I’m experiencing the trauma response you described. If I could just fix him and heal myself then we could go back to what we had (or what I thought we had). We had two cats together, I adopted them before we met though and they came with me when my ex and I split. But I didn’t want them to lose their second human, that’s part of why I stayed so long. They’ve both seemed a bit lost since I left him. 

OP — don’t stay, not even for your baby. My parents had something like this happen in their relationship and I wish so badly that they had split. Divorce is hard but being the nearly 40 year kid whose toxic parents are still together is worse, I think. At least divorced you’d be able to seek and hopefully find a person you love who could really be a good role model and step-parent.",0,1719795521,,,0,lb275l9,t3_1dsbiqz,t1_lb1vxyx,1719795539,8,False,survivinginfidelity,t5_2x8ez

4. And possibly the worst. Trump claims he has been the best president for the environment.

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don’t how to explain this info, but here’s something. 

I have a different ailment, that I’ve found great success with , and I’m coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it’s conditionally essential. In children it’s much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It’s also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it’s top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn’t scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn’t scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone’s comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‘autoimmune’ diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it’s called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it’s implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in “global protein metabolism” when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability. 

It came to me almost like a soft impulse. I googled LONG COVID TAURINE and the first thing that comes up is this, 

https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2023/10/researchers-identify-amino-acid-that-may-play-key-role-for-predicting-treating-long-covid.html.

I mean taurine isn’t even in the title. There’s something here, it’s super cheap to supplement. Studies have shown use of up to 6g a day. It’s in red meat. It’s in breast milk.

wawcod,,,"a lot of these are reviews of the same studies with the same flaws that I mentioned

But it does seem that there are some newer studies accounting for these flaws (still self reported though it seems, which I still don't like)

So it is probably true that red meat/processed meats increase your risk for certain types of cancer, but the attempt to maximize our risk assessment and live according to that seems a bit silly to me. We can do this and avoid these things but then every time we.. step outside, stay in the sun for too long, especially get into a CAR or be near cars we're drastically increasing our danger risks. And I mean we can live with 110% absolute PERFECT risk managed lifestyles and still get cancer tomorrow. Or we can live like complete shit and live to 110.

The fact is that in the west, processed foods make up HUGE portions of our diets but we still have pretty high life expectancies compared to a lot of the world. For example, Australia has a 65% overweight/obesity rate and ultra processed foods make up nearly half of their diet, but they're still in the #10 spot for life expectancy with 83.73 (85.56 for females, 81.89 for males)

I would argue that if you're not eating any fast food and eating a ROUGHLY healthy diet, even if you have red meat in there your risk of death is still going to be MASSIVELY lower than the average western person.  Also don't think it's fair to declare bison as an ""unhealthy"" food even if there is an increased cancer risk, because it objectively does have a lot of health benefits (""High in B-vitamins like B12, B6, and riboflavin, bison meat helps improve mood, brain function and metabolism."")",0,1719800595,,,0,lb2j7mo,t3_15nag56,t1_lb18zvo,1719800612,1,False,naturalbodybuilding,t5_2vx10

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

ArrowheadDZ,,,"The thing we’ve lost sight of is this:  the Federalist Society is profoundly well funded, highly organized, and has infiltrated every law school in the country.  It is virtually impossible for a law student to hold any leadership position or have a prestigious role like being the school’s law review editor without having the connections that accompany Society membership.

And in fact, people forget that in March and again in June, 2016, candidate Trump was trailing in the polls, and then made a public campaign promise to only appoint judges and justices recommended to him by the Federalist Society.  He literally promised to outsource the nominating process to the society, and nominate   whoever they told him to nominate.  His polling jump 3% when he first published his list of 21 possible SCOTUS candidates, and jumped again in June when he promised that he would always nominate whoever he was told and wouldn’t go “rogue” as other presidents had done.

Why do I recount all this here?  Because what we fail to realize is that the Federalist Society, despite its name and its elite, influential standing, is profoundly and deeply anti-democracy.  Their central tenet, their litmus test for judgeship, for campus leadership, for scholarships, is adherence to their president-as-serial-monarch philosophy.  They give it glossy names like unitary executive, but if you read the writings of proponents like Bill Barr or Alberto Gonzales, it becomes very clear that the President is the leader of the people, and not simply the head of the executive branch.

The Federalist Society was part of a well-funded long term war plan to wrest control of the government by going after the courts, rather than through electoral means, and they have succeeded.  They placed adherents in the vice presidency, two attorneys general, hundreds of state and federal judgeships, and what appears to be at least 5 but possibly 6 Justices.

We are completely distracted.  We worry about MAGA, we worry about the likes of Desantis and Abbott, we worry about the theocracy now in place in Louisiana and Oklahoma, and coming soon elsewhere.  But those battles are just that, planned distractions that take our eye of the serial monarchy, the “dictator lite” model that the Federalist Society promotes.  They have no transparency, no accountability, are unelected,and yet they represent the single most powerful voice in American governance, bar none.

Between the Federalist Society and Project 2025, we are facing a complete dismantling of the democracy experiment.  We’re just two years shy of the 250 year anniversary, and by all accounts it appears we couldn’t make it.

I won’t candy coat any of this.  If we don’t find a way to stop the Federalist Society and rid ourselves of the lethal cancer they represent, there’s no way out of this.  This is a stage 4 malignancy, it’s spread everywhere, and that was always the plan.  Their plan was always for the chains of authoritarianism to be too light to be felt, until they were too strong to be broken.

I don’t care who you are, or what story you’ve told yourself… if you are a member of, a supporter of, or sympathetic to the Federalist Society, no matter the reason, you are the single existential threat to democracy in America.  You either know it, or are deliberately turning a blind eye to it, but don’t lie and say you weren’t aware.

I don’t know what the right answer is.  We’re America, so rounding you up and putting you in indoctrination camps is pretty antithetical to our principles.  But I don’t see anyway that a liberal democracy has ever been able to break the authoritarian groundswells that have devours so many educated, industrialized, free nations.  The Democratic Party lacks the backbone to use the powers the courts are granting the executive, and so our government is a ratchet that can only move on one direction.  Nationalist authoritarian movements tighten the bolt when they have the wrench, and liberals just hold steady on the status quo, with no will to losses the bolt, undoing the damage of the previous tightening.  And so the bolt only turns one way, and the only thing we’re left to decide is whether it tightens faster or slower.",0,1719848779,,,0,lb5447q,t3_1dsupsh,t3_1dsupsh,1719848793,52,False,politics,t5_2cneq

AngeredReclusivity,,Nursing Student 🍕,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

PaedsRants,,,"Paeds here! Unfortunately this all depends on age + pathology/specialty + local pathways, so I can't really give a generic answer for you, but if you are a permanent/regular member of staff and not a locum GP doing a shift somewhere new then you should really be making the effort to get to know the pathways in your area (or know where to find them). I'm sure you can appreciate how frustrating it is for a busy paeds reg to be getting GP calls about e.g. a 13yo with ?SUFE, when they know that should be a direct referral to ortho with no paeds input required.


For the record, I do not know of a single pathway that requires you as the referring GP to discuss the patient with 2 separate teams, so if an ortho/gen surg is asking you to do that after they've accepted the patient, you can and should push back on this. If their protocol demands a paeds review for every child with abdo pain under 12 or whatever, that is for them to sort out, NOT you as the referring GP.


If in doubt + worried + busy++, by all means send them to ED with a letter and let ED figure it out, but that is very suboptimal for obvious reasons.


A few broad principles to consider (and definitely don't take as gospel and do check how it's done locally):


- the younger they are, the more likely it is you need to refer to paeds first rather than to specialty directly. Anything over 6 is not that young, and *probably* doesn't need to see paeds first. Anything over 12 is basically small adult territory, and almost certainly doesn't need to see paeds first.


- is your local hospital a tertiary or DGH? If it's tertiary, there is generally more scope to refer direct to specialty, e.g. discuss your ?quinsy directly with the paeds ENT team. If it's remote DGH, then probably should run it by the local paeds reg first.


- how ""acutely unwell"" are they? If it's an infective pathology with risk of sepsis, or there's cancer high on the differential, it's more likely they need to see paeds first. But again, if it's barndoor surgical like an abscess or septic joint, you can usually refer directly to the surgical specialty and let them bleep paeds as necessary.


- gen surg/paeds surg: there is often an age cutoff for appendicitis, e.g. above 12 the adult gen surgeons at the DGH will see, below 12 they need to see paeds first, who will refer to paeds surg as necessary. Likewise, for paediatric-specific pathology like pyloric stenosis, refer to paeds first.


- ENT: probably the most pathology-specific and variable as per local pathways. If it's really a barndoor ENT pathology that's likely to need surgical intervention (thinking textbook quinsy or mastoiditis), then I would strongly encourage you to refer to ENT directly, even at a DGH - but pathways vary.


In summary, you just have to learn what the pathways are locally, which will come with time and experience.",0,1719849816,,,0,lb579b1,t3_1dspn56,t3_1dspn56,1719849831,5,False,GPUK,t5_8aw5or

The second night we shared a tent with a triple Scorpio who claimed to have caused the hurricane because he realized how hot his girlfriend was, and became consumed with fear of losing her. He was also big on sacrifices to ""Mako the shark god."" A bit of a troll having fun with the tourists.

Then we stayed a night with some people he knew from back in the day, who thankfully were not nuts.

THEN we stayed the rest of the time at a beach house with the most Boomer guy I've ever met. He lived with ten women who all worked in a strip club in Texas, which financed their Scuba diving vacations. His guru thing was being an expert on ""rebirthing"" - get it, Mars in Cancer? He was verbally abusive and obsessed with watching basketball all day, which somehow fit his dudebro energy. My husband was one of his few guy friends.

That's just a small amount of the nuttiness, but the whole eight months was pretty much one loony experience after another. Oh, one highlight was driving around Texas all summer with a former stripper (the guru's ex) who'd become an heiress.

It has problems, no doubt. Certain things happen that don't make a TON of sense with how we know the force to work, and the reveal of ol' boy as the dark side master was obvious since he met Osha.

The show's still *fun*, though, despite some inconsistencies. One of the biggest complaints I've seen are about Ki-Adi-Mundi's Sith line and this dude clearly being a Sith. Here's the rub, though; the hyper-manipulative Qimir, aka The Stranger, says he has no name; all Sith have a title. He also says something like, ""I have no name. But **Jedi like you** might call me... **Sith[?]**.""

He phrases it in a way that couches the word ""Sith"" in the Jedi's fundamentally flawed understanding of the Sith and what dark side users are. Up until this point, all dark side users have been called Sith by the Jedi... but not all dark side users ***are Sith***. As someone who's been gaslit a lot in my life, it's pretty obvious here that he's not answering the question straight; he's giving them an answer that they expect, that they can understand, so he can keep them off balance. And it works, too; seconds later, Jecki's dead.

I think that much like Baylan Skoll, The Stranger isn't a Sith, but just a powerful force user who utilizes the dark side. He's wearing a helmet both to hide his identity, and because Disney needs to sell toys.

Do you want to know what is really helpful for people like myself and you?

Sharing stories. You sharing this helps people who may be anticipating or maybe even just experienced a similar loss know that how they feel is normal.

Grief is so complex, and I remember feeling so strange, and often still do as a director. I don't see it as selfish or making it about yourself at all. I cry at funerals for people I don't even know all the time. My heart breaks all the time for people. So, what I see reading your story is empathy and sympathy.

This is a family you were close to. You have compassion. You watched them hurt, and you are hurting. That's 100% okay and valid.

Perhaps when the dust settles and you have the strength sit and have brunch or coffee and explain to them how you feel. How it hurt to see them that way. I think what I see the most from my end is that people are afraid of saying the wrong thing when in reality people need to hear it.


A conversation that encircles but in more detail:
It hurt too see you hurt that much. My heart is absolutely broken with you. I am so sorry.

A lot of people who experience loss will have moments of feeling like they aren't really being seen. It can be really cathartic to share that feeling of loss with them. I promise they won't find you selfish. If anything probably honored that he meant so much and that they mean so much.

People also like to speak about what happened fairly often. So, perhaps your honesty will make them feel safe enough to share, which will in turn give you clarity. Talking about grief is very healing.

AMCreative,,SAG-AFTRA | TV/Film,"Couldn’t disagree harder. Let’s dissect.

“Look at all of these people who never took a class”

This is a logical fallacy called “Survivor Bias”. Other examples are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never having gone to college.

“I have taken 5 classes and only 1 was decent”

This is a statistical error centered around sample size.

If I told you I had a medication that cured cancer because 5 people took it and 1 went into remission would you trust that pill?

“I could have learned all of these things on my own”

And you should. IMO classes and self-motivated learning are independent tracks. One augments the fruits of the other.

“Long time students with the teacher have no credits”

And? 95% of actors don’t make a living acting. That’s the likelihood of you pulling any actor out of the wind and checking their credits, not just long term actors with a coach.

Further, and you should know this as a business major, acting classes rarely teach explicitly acting business strategy and entrepreneurship. So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren’t regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students… don’t do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher’s fault?

“I’ve had acting coaches tell me I’d never book a co Star then I did”

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

“Coaches don’t want people to be successful because they won’t study anymore”

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You’re not even thinking your arguments through now.

“I’ve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique”

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it’s something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it’s on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

—-

It feels like you’re treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don’t see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it’s always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I’m at the point where, generally, I don’t learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

SpiderCop_NYPD_ARKND,,,"Keyword ""perceived"", as it does none of the above as a part of its modern fiction or intention.

I work in Health Insurance with the ACA, so I'll go over all 3 of those: 

(1) The current ACA doesn't overreach government authority at all. Everything the current ACA does,  it does with existing Government Authority, the two exceptions,  the initial requirement that States expand their Medicaid programs to cover anyone with income at or below the Federal Poverty Level,  was struck down before the law ever took effect in 2014, and the requirement for individuals to have Health Insurance coverage or face a fee on their taxes was reduced to zero in 2018 (though this actually did more harm than good,  see 1A).

(1A) The requirement for private individuals to have coverage or face a fine was actually a cost saving measure. By having a many people covered as possible, they increased the pool of premiums paid in, which is the pool used to pay out claims. By removing that requirement and shrinking that pool, Insurance providers (companies) have had to raise premiums to keep up with the increased numbers and costs of claims from expanded access. All insurance uses this pool & pay system, good drivers car insurance is used to pay the claims of accident prone drivers. People who live in places with good weathers home insurance premiums are used to pay claims of people who live in tornado alley or in coastal areas with hurricanes. Healthy peoples health insurance premiums were already used to pay for sick people's claims. All removing the requirement for was shrink the pool and make it more expensive for everyone. Which has just exacerbated the cost increases to be addressed in point 2.

(2) Cost is something difficult to understand,  so I'm going to get into how costs have increased as a result of the ACA to help people understand that it really isn't the ACAs fault. To start,  it must be understood that *access* to Healthcare is different than *having* Healthcare. Access to Healthcare is having insurance and doctors/hospitals/pharmacy services (providers) that take that insurance that you could choose to use. Healthcare is the services those providers, well, provide. The ACA is there to provide access,  not Healthcare.  It helps people get and afford insurance. It does not,  however, educate or hire new doctors, specialists or, pharmacists, build new hospitals or doctors offices,  or otherwise increase the number of providers available. So, basic supply and demand applies,  if you increase the number of people with access (demand) but don't increase the number of providers (supply), what happens is basic economics,  the suppliers raise prices. These people are in are also more expensive to treat,  which I'll cover in 2A. *However*, things don't stop there.  With increased demand,  supply always tries to expand to meet it. But with specialized services like Healthcare,  that takes time.  If fast food demand goes up,  you can train a thousand new fry cooks in a week if the labor pool is there, but it takes upwards of a decade to become a general practice doctor, longer to become a specialist. Supply hasn't had enough time to answer the increase in demand yet. Further, people having access to and using Healthcare will in the long run reduce costs,  because someone who can go get that funny feeling checked out and catches their cancer at stage 1 is cheaper and easier to treat than that same person without access who let's it faster into they end up in the ER and discover it at stage 4, but that also takes decades to happen. How do we know all this? Because we've seen it happen in dozens of nations that instituted single payer systems in the latter half of the 20th century.  The same patterns played out every time,  an initial huge spike in costs, followed by a gradual decline as demand expanded and general public beauty improved. We're just happen to still be in the spike.

(2A) There's also the fact that the ACA eliminated the ability of Insurance Companies to discriminate against the people most in need of coverage,  people with preexisting conditions. If you had something like arthritis,  and you had a gap in coverage (for whatever reason) longer than a certain period,  *if* you got renewed coverage (they could also simply refuse your business entirely) insurance used to be able to just tell you you were out of luck regarding coverage of your arthritis because it was preexisting with a period where it was unmanaged. Sucked for you,  but it saved the insatiable company money (and thus,  saved those they would cover money since they weren't paying premiums to cover those claims). The ACA made it so that they have to cover you and can't charge you more for having preexisting conditions.

(3) I've actually already covered the effect on private insurance really, those who previously already had coverage are now competing with ACA coverage recipients for a limited supply of provider services, so they're seeking the price increases as well as having harder times getting appointments.

But all of it,  all of this,  is secondary effects and side effects of *trying to fix what was fundamentally a broken system*, a system designed to  cover healthy people and fuck over everyone who actually needed Healthcare. Working in this field, the people who I hear complain about it,  are the ones who were benefiting from that system as it was before,  healthy or well off people who had insurance before the changes and didn't get shafted by it at the time who are bitching about the fact that the system is working to cover people it wouldn't before and that's making things (momentarily, as I've explained above) more expensive.",0,1719853101,,,0,lb5hc8p,t3_1dswbj3,t1_lb54utl,1719853119,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i
goldenphotog,,,"Oh man, I hate that. I can’t say much for the recurring dreams part because this was a one-time thing if I remember. I’m going to paste a response I made to someone else because I think it would apply to you, and I’ll also add that nipples can shrivel up at even very slight stimulation so unless it looked so weird to the point where your breast looks dented or something I wouldn’t worry much about the shriveling. Here’s what I had said previously to someone:

I’m so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I’ve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery— they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn’t see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She’s not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it’s something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it’s really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day. You don’t mess around with this shit, and if your doctor seems to not be taking you seriously, find a new one.

Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren’t just a moral good because they prevent disease; they’re a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they’re essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we’re talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation—traits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate’s last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren’t just about reducing cancer rates—they’re about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let’s face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it’s right to recycle or how to create a more just society.

pnam0204,,,"**THE ETERNAL HERO AND THE FINALITY**

“What nonsense are you spewing? A destructor don’t solve problems, I end both the troublemakers and the victims equally.”

The feminine boy in highschool girl uniform look up from his phone, he’s clearly annoyed at the intruder and their accusation. Part of him was also surprise that someone suddenly found him. But a quick glance at the soul and he already realize she’s an acquantaince. Much like himself, the Reincarnated Hero is also a constant variable throughout countless worlds. However, to retain past life’s memory and recognize him like this is still the first time occurence.

“I’ve seen through your facade. You’re not a heartless destroyer as you always claimed to be.”

Yurika the Infinite Reincarnator claim, this might be the first time she meet this boy in front of her in this life, but she had also met and fought side-by-side or clashed blade with countless other versions of him during her infinite lives

“You save helpless victims while saying you’ll end then when their ‘expiry date’ actually come. You slain corrupted gods because they reach ‘expiry date’. You cure cancer while calling it ‘killing the errors’. Yet your goodwills never extend to humanity as a whole. You can slay eldritch horrors from another dimensions yet refuse to lift a finger when wars break out”

“And why should I? Great power great responsibilities? Ridiculous! Just the excuses greedy humanity uses to exploit the goodwill of those with power. You think you ants can exploit me the same way?”

“I simply can’t understand you. After unlocking memories of all my previous lives, I recognize you in every of them. You have the power, you have the goodwills, yet you always chose to be a bystander even when humanity of that world was dying.”

Yurika has deduced from experience and past lives’ memories that the boy in front of her is not a regular mortal. He’s some kind of divine beings that’s also different than the gods she had seen. Not bound by worship, humanity or even the world. His Authority exceeds even that of whatever Chief God of any world despite being a foreign entity in their home turf. Yet he standby idly whenever apocalyptic events happened. And instead of helping the remaining human rebuild, he simply end the world itself.

“Simple, I have tried it countless time before. I have grown bored after every attempt end in failure.”

“How? You have the power to reshape reality. You can bend humans to you whims without none of us be the wiser.”

“Because of freewill and you human’s earthly desires. I gave human blessings to push back against demon, you human used it to oppress other races as the ‘divine chosen’. I gave you abundance of resource that can lead to post-scarcity utopia, you human somehow made poverty gap and resource war even worse. I gave you space travel to escape your dying planet and you used it to expand and conquer”

The feminine boy dejectedly dropped his phone and started slurping his hot cup noodle. Yurika knew full well he’s a divine being who can reshape reality with his thoughts, yet somehow he seems very… human. His expressions were not that of a “holier than thou” like other gods, he just seemed like a disappoint parents who gave up on their unruly children.

“Surely you can enforce rules and punishments to discipline humanity?”

“It’s only called discipline when parents do that to their child. But I am not your parents, nor do humanity see yourself as children. Therefore it’d be called dictatorship instead.”

“So you tried that too?”

“Yes.”

The boy snapped his finger, the room change into a scenary of another world. Events were happening in fast-foward like a video recording.

“I got rid of the evils in human hearts once, it led to a utopia of harmony where people can do no wrongs. You might not remember but you were there too, your first life before you were granted the ability to reincarnate. You broke free from the harmony, regained your individualism and rebeled. You declared good and evil must co-exist and it’s human nature to triump over their inner evil to do good. You considered the human with no capacity for evil at all is no different than machine programmed with the Three Laws. You said humanity’s fate should be in humanity’s hand, not decided by an almighty being”

Yurika silently watched as the climatic battle of her first self unfolded. Mortals vs gods. She was no match in battle but she won the debate. She successfully convinced the boy to return freewill to everyone.

Then it was chaos. She naively believed people who experienced thar utopia of goodness and harmony for so long would know better than to ruin it. But greed and selfishness quickly took over. Free health care system began to charge patients for money. Food distribution system fell apart. People were driven out of their own house because it’s no longer free. The Heroine herself tried to fix it, but then was framed and executed.

And then she was reincarnated. In each new life she always had the great desire to do good and help the world. Yet none of her lives were successful no matter how many times it happened. Sometimes her sacrifices were in vain, sometimes peace fell apart as soon she - the hero figure - passed away, sometimes she was betrayed “for the greater good”

Then Yurika realize something.

“Wait, so my reincarnation power was yours?”

“Yes. After the fight with you, I gave up on trying to save humanity, I lost my goodwill for them. But as you know, I can still have bias toward individuals, one of which is you. I let you reincarnate endlessly so you can carry on my old goodwill for humanity.”

Yurika was speechless. She was tired of her constant previous failures, so she seek out the familiar feminine boy to ask for his direct help. She never expect the truth to be like this.
The reason she is here asking for divine intervention to saving humanity was because of herself rejected it in the far distance past.

“As past you once said, human’s fate should be in human’s hand, so you should be saving humanity instead of me. Does that answer your question?”",0,1719802883,,,0,lb2ofjl,t3_1dpkop5,t3_1dpkop5,1719802900,1,False,WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb

Rare_Bee_7777,default,,"Hi. I'm sorry for the late reply.

My son was born premature and already ill since birth. He was born with problems with his heart and lung, went though several surgeries to fix the issue, but heart and lung problems continue until today. He have gene mutations, and developed various Autoimmune diseases.

So, it is kind of hard to catch a new diagnosis, as the symptoms are overlapping with another diseases.

But for the Cancer specifically, we first notice his right eye swollen. It was just a little swollen at first, even the doctor couldn't really see it. But since he have a long medical history, they schedule us for further test.

Other than swollen eye, I'm sure he have another symptoms, but it is overlapping with another conditions (like bruises, petechiae, bone pain especially on lower extremities, nose bleed, gum bleed, etc). It turns out to be Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a blood Cancer.

On the same week, he went though his regular CT and MRI (he does these scans regularly every 3-4 months for some reason), they found tumor on his right side of his pelvic area with ""a little bit"" metastases to the spine, it is another Cancer. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Totally unrelated to the blood Cancer. At that time, he experience pain on his right hip.

It is called MPCs (Multiple Primary Cancers) or MPMs (Multiple Primary Malignancies). It is not happening very often, especially on pediatrics.

Otherwise how do you control the private commercial activity between a transgender person and their doctor? You would need to give government complete access to all medical records in order for that to be something they can control.


Personally I don't care if adults ""mutilate"" their own bodies. I believe in personal freedom and if you want to cut off an ear or put cancerous ink into your epidermis then I don't agree with those actions but I don't think they should be illegal and I don't think we should give the government the tools necessary to monitor and enforce it.


Transgender is the same. I don't have to agree with it but enforcing restrictions on adults is an open door for government to abuse it. As soon as we let the government get between me and my doctor and tell me what I can and cannot do with my body then maybe today it's transgender surgery and abortions but tomorrow it's piercings and tattoos. It's like the Patriot act, they rammed it through and just have continued to expand it, you give government any little control over your body and they will just take as much power over your bodily autonomy as they can.


So we have a choice. Either government gets to tell all of us what we can and cannot do to our bodies or the government cannot tell any adult what they can or cannot do, you cannot just pick one group of people who you want to control.

Nazon6,,,">Nope, I said comparing the human drive and ability in sexual intercourse to a nuclear reactor technician is fucking dumb.

And again, I pointed out that you're misunderstanding my point because you don't know what an analogy is. It's not about the OBJECTS in the analogy, it's about the PRINCIPLE. Im not sure if english is your first language or not (which I don't mean in any offense, I just mean it for the sake of the argument), but let me illustrate it for you:

1. A full grown adult tells a young child that it's okay for them to have sex. The child is naive and is relying on the adult to be telling the truth. The adult ends up sexually abusing them because the child doesn't know any better, thus, trauma develops in the child. Note that not every experience will be like this.
2. An experience nuclear reactor technician tells an average citizen that knows nothing of a nuclear reactor that it's okay for them to operate the machine. The citizen is naive and is relying on the technician to be telling the truth. The citizen ends up leaking radioactive material into their enclosed operating room, thus, cancer develops in the citizen. Note that not every experience will be like this.

See the similarities? Again, I'm not comparing a technician to a predator, but the principles for why both circumstances are wrong is the same.

LizzieMac123,,,"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time.

Harmatsis,,,"I’ll be honest. I think it has all gotten out of hand. I was hungry one day, so I made hard boiled eggs. My girlfriend walked into the kitchen.

“I was going to ask you to some hard boiled eggs.” She told me.

“Oh I knew. I know everything.”

“Really?” She asked jokingly “what else do you know?”

“Well I know that a plane will crash, a dog will come to our door, and the lotto numbers are 23 17 18 73 92 12.”

She laughed it off and turned on the tv. A few minutes later, she yelled at me to see the news. A plane had apparently crashed in the field in Kansas. Thankfully no one was hurt.

“That’s funny don’t you think? You guess a plane would crash and it happened.”

“Didn’t guess. I knew. Woohoo” I wiggled my fingers in her face like a wizard. 

I was putting the eggs away, when I heard a knock at the door. There was a man holding a cute beagle.

“Hey there you missing this guy?” The man said gesturing the dog towards me.

“No.” I was confused.

“Really? Because this address is on its collar.” He proceeded to show me the collar. It did in fact have my address on it. I eventually took the dog. I can call animal control to see if it’s chipped.

I told my girlfriend and she was flabbergasted. “A dog came to our door? Like you said it would?”

“Yeah I guess. Weird coincidence.”

“Yeah.” She trailed off. She called animal control and they found no chip. So for the time being, he was ours.

We both went off the work, and when got home we had dinner. My girlfriend asked me to switch to the news so she could see the lottery drawing. I obliged and waited. Then, a miracle happened. A woman in a gown said “23 17 18 73 92 12”. I was amazed, and hardly recognized that my girlfriend was reading a ticket. 

“We won!” She proclaimed. “How do you know those numbers?”

“I didn’t, I just said random numbers.”

“Well, say more random numbers.” She said.

I asked her if she was serious. She believed I could actually speak my will into reality. This was made even stranger when we picked up the large lottery check, for the news. She loudly told everyone about how I did this, and I could do it again. I was embarrassed. Why would my girlfriend say something so dumb. But the dumbest part was that people believed her. 

People began to congregate around our house. She would tell them regularly of how my predictions were correct, and I could speak anything into the universe. It became a struggle to enter and exit my house. I would be surrounded by zealots and the desperate. How do you respond to a dying man who asks you to cure their cancer? I haven’t figured it. I just keep my head down and don’t respond, as I do with all of the cultists.

My girlfriend asked why I haven’t made any prediction since the lottery win. I told her honestly. “I don’t have powers. I jokingly lied to you, and fate has contrived itself to make it seem like the truth.”

Her eyes flashed. “Eggs.”

“Eggs?”

“You need to hard boil more eggs. That’s when you made your predictions! You need to hard boil more eggs!”

“But we’re out of eggs.” I said exasperated 

She ran to the door. She screamed over the crowd of chanting freaks. “Your master needs eggs! The first one to get us some will have their wish granted.” The following stampede injured 8. After 10 minutes, we were flooded with eggs. They were screaming and shouting about how they got there first or how their eggs were of the highest quality. I could not handle this any further.  I ran into the bedroom and locked the door. The knocking on the door grew stronger each second. I had to get out. I saw the window being a little open, and knew it was my exit. So with a single jump, I was on the road.

The point of my post was that eating animals usually requires raping them first through artificial insemination. So it's hypocritical to attack animal rapists while paying for farmers to rape animals for you.

Then there's the issue of incidental vs inherent harm. I contributed to giving the migrant skin cancer so I could get tomatoes, this is less bad than if I had mutated his DNA to give him cancer in order to get tomatoes from him. There isn't a causal link between getting cancer and producing tomatoes, they share a cause instead. While the meat production has meat that is causal of animal death. Meat without animal death is possible, tomatoes without migrant death is perfectly possible
 
I used to grow tomatoes in my back yard and no migrants died for that as we didn't use migrants for tomatoes, we only killed migrants by shotgun shot to the back of the head for our burgers... To most people what I just said sounds fucked up which should show you the difference between direct an incidental harm. Although both a migrant dying for tomato production and to make our burgers leads to the death of a migrant, one sounds way more fucked up than the other.

My furry companions have taught me more than any human on this earth. It was my smallest who had cancer who taught me that I actually did have a soul, heart and she lit the pilot which had been extinguished a very long time ago. I watched the tumor grow, made the decision to have it attended to and in true form she opened her incision four times post surgery which severely put a scar on my finances but it bought me eight months of lessons and compassion I never knew I was capable of. As I write this I am not certain of my fate as I am in caught in the middle of a mental minefield that I created and only after many months of seclusion have I realized the magnitude of my behavior. It was only seeing my reflection in my animals actions did I realize the gravity of my situation.

Pensive_Fool,,,"Statistically the risk of colorectal cancer in those under age 50 is quite low, and depending on the local guidelines where you reside, might not necessitate a screening colonoscopy even for those with first degree relatives diagnosed with the condition. De novo mutations, unless with risk factors such as prior radiation exposure, are uncommon in younger individuals; were someone to have colon cancer in their 30s, then suspicion for familial conditions such as adenomatous polyposis would often be considered, but the expectation would be for multiple family members to be involved generally. That being said, if you have concerns about symptoms, or of possible malignancy, then a visit to your healthcare provider may be warranted.

With regards to your fear of cancer, would there be a reason why, and for colon cancer specifically? Nonetheless, it may be worth considering speaking to your healthcare provider about the matter as significant worries may be a manifestation of anxiety which is statistically not uncommon in today's society.

You are correct in that some locations have noticed a statistical increase in cancer detection rates, but healthcare providers may also be more cautious as a result and have a lower threshold for initiating investigations, not of all which require invasive testing. And note that sometimes increases are more a reflection of increased screening rather than a true increase in incidence.",0,1719805781,,,0,lb2uhsf,t3_1dsirdd,t3_1dsirdd,1719805796,1,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy

One_Grapefruit_8512,,,"You’re not crazy, unfortunately. We adopted her  in February (about 5.5 years old) from original owner who basically was providing PetSmart care 😔 and thought Zeke was a male. We bought a new enclosure and got husbandry all up to speed. Her first vet visit was “okay” though we weren’t thrilled with the vet necessarily. She said back leg bones felt a little soft and gave us liquid calcium for daily use. Toward the end of April I noticed her pulling her ribs in every now and then like labored breathing. Took her back to same vet for possible URI. Found fluid in abdominal cavity. Said could be from heart or liver issues, possibly cancer. Offered to euthanize right then and there. Didn’t really talk about diagnostics or treatment. 
We decided to get a second opinion and the next day my husband and I both took off work, started driving, prepared to go the 90 minutes for an exotics only clinic south of San Francisco. But I was also making calls as we were driving and we found another exotics a little closer to home who could do an urgent appt. She said similar things to first vet (including euthanasia option), mentioned a possible tumor in abdomen. She also said we could do bloodwork and x-rays. This was a Friday afternoon and the results were back Monday. Bloodwork was “surprisingly normal,” no signs of infection, normal blood sugar, etc. but x-rays showed several opaque oval structures, possible egg follicles. Did ultrasound the next day and confirmed female & egg bound. Had surgery two days later where they removed 25-30 egg follicles. Came home with antibiotics. Surgery was May 3rd and recovery has been gradual. At the time she also had some pretty bad sores on her tongue that both vets weren’t really sure of the cause so even though she was interested bugs she was having trouble getting them to stick. We were giving  critical care for the first 2-3 weeks post op. So, probably a longer answer than you were expecting… but her appetite is slowly returning. I suppose it’s possible she may have other issues that aren’t clear but she’s eating and drinking and pooping. Loves her time outside in our backyard. Super tolerant of being held.

NoRoyal2270,,,"I have to admit, that’s the best point I’ve seen anybody make on it. And I will concede that for the most part your correct. Government has become too large and too pervasive within our society. As well as nobody should come between you and your doctor. 

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‘should’ be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn’t a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don’t believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don’t know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I’ll restate that you’re correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can’t chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don’t do those sorts of  things. It would be disgusting to trust a person with anorexia when they say they’re overweight. The same goes for men and women who believe they can change their sex. We can’t.

Secure-Dare3782,,,"We sent our vet a cake large enough for the whole office with a card after one of my pups needed to have an eye removed due to juvenile glaucoma.

My pug pups are about 10 months old now. We brought them home toward the end of last year because I was struggling severely with depression after losing my closest family member to cancer. These puppies saved my life absolutely. Finding out that one of them was in severe pain and would need the eye removed was almost like I was losing my family all over again. I was visibly distraught at the vets office and couldn’t hold it back. Both boys lifted me up so much after the death that I couldn’t stand the thought that one of them was in excruciating pain.

This woman really is amazing. She assured me that he was going to be just fine and to just trust her. Well, Greyson has been the happiest little boy since having it removed a few months ago. Most people don’t even realize the eye isn’t there unless they get really close. She even spent extra time matching the “wrinkles” pugs have on each side so that he still looked completely symmetrical. He is adorable and I truly believe he could not be happier. 

She took all his pain away and checked on him and his behavior daily for about 2 weeks after. She deserved her cake and her card. I would do it over again and recommend her to absolutely anybody.

CrossdressTimelady,,,"Oh god, where to begin unpacking this one.  
  
It's sometimes in the small details.  Driving from northern New Hampshire back to South Dakota and just noticing how oddly expensive supplies are along the way.  ""How did I just pay $15 for an energy drink and one of those little travel-sized packets of antacids that have like 1-2 doses in them?  Really?  $15?  That seems like a lot even at a rest stop.  How did buying one meal at Wendy's and splitting it just cost me $20?  Why isn't anything in the motel room working properly?""  Those are the boring details.

The more interesting small details that just feel a little ""off"", like the old world was traded out for a new and slightly shittier model while we were all knocked unconscious are things like, ""why does this small town in Pennsylvania look totally abandoned?  None of the houses have lights on.  Somehow it's darker than rural South Dakota out here.  There's no signs of life anywhere... oh shit, this town lost about half its population after 2020.  We're basically driving through a ghost town.""  It's meeting up with my business partner who just spent the week in New York City instead of driving across the country like I did and hearing about how all of his normally successful friends can't find work-- and neither could he.  How he saw one of my close friends that I met while working on TV and film in the Before Times, and how she couldn't find a job either-- the film sets are closed.  It's the moment when he showed her pictures of ""Out of Lockstep"" and she teared up-- even though it was pictures of the funny part and she was very pro-mandate in 2021.  The really strange details are things like hearing from my dad about how he tracks the crime rates in Rochester NY like they're the weather report now-- he needs to know how bad it is before deciding to go out for the day.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

It's moments like the unvaxxed gathering at PorcFest, where EVERYONE had stories about losing jobs, friends, and family members.  Family members that weren't lost to the political division were lost to ""sudden"" deaths and aggressive cancers.  On the car ride out to the Northeast, I texted some friends in NYC while my travel buddy was taking the wheel.  On the way back, I heard from one of those friends that her mom has cancer now.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.  I channeled years of anger, grief, and dark humor into an art installation that fills multiple rooms.  There was enough of those feelings to keep growing it larger and adding more.  I don't know if I'll \*ever\* find closure by doing this project, but at least I'm doing way better than I would be without it.

briggles23,,,"Probably the wrong thread to post this comment, but I can't find any better thread so sorry in advance for the rant I'm about to go on.

I saw a commenter in another thread laughing about how he saw someone saying they expect Dutton to win the next election. If they stepped out of your internet hive-minded group think and have a look at the current polls as we're heading towards the next election, they'd see that there's basically nothing between Albo and Dutton for who's gonna win the next election. Don't forget that Shorten was a sure thing to win the 2019 election with even Mainstream news media all but accepting an LNP defeat, but still somehow lost to Morrison. 

The LNP holds the biggest voter base in our country and the only way they lose is through preferential voting. In 2022, The LNP still won the popular vote in pretty much every state and Territory despite Morrison's severe unpopularity at that point. They still only lost due to Labor having enough no. 1 preferences which they simply won't have nearly as many come 2025, and other people preferencing Labor higher than the LNP, which again Labor won't get nearly as many. 

Dutton also has pretty much all the media on his side, plus any media that's pro Greens because they're also against Labor which only helps Dutton and the LNP. So he's getting little if not zero push back on his insanely idiotic Nuclear Energy scheme, in fact you had ""journalists"" telling Albo he should be praising Dutton for his Nuclear policy after questioning why Albo and the Labor party are against it. That's the state of journalism in our country. It's all batting for one side and nothing is stopping them from doing so. 

Labor could cure all known cancer and the media would call them out on why people are still breaking their bones or getting the flu. Meanwhile the LNP could start mass murdering everyone and the media would praise them for helping with overpopulation. 

I'm worried that Dutton will win the next election through no fault of the Albanese Labor Government, but through pure media manipulation. Dutton has brought nothing good to the table and the only thing he's being hard on is his Nuclear Policy. Even if you're for that his Nuclear Policy, do you really want Dutton and the LNP to be at the forefront of Nuclear Power in this country? I'd say no, you wouldn't be for that at all. 

Remember to preference Liberals and the LNP last, as well as their sister parties like One Nation and UAP. They aren't for you, they're for their donors and shareholders. That's it. If you don't want to preference Labor first, at least have them above those other three.",0,1719807190,,,0,lb2xa1c,t3_1drykf1,t3_1drykf1,1719807205,3,False,friendlyjordies,t5_321dg

PatientNobody9503,,,"Thank you for your insight. I am an introvert, but I can be an extrovert too at times if I'm comfortable enough in a situation. I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

The only reason I want to find other converts is because they have seen a lot of what I have seen likely growing up in the Western world and not being born muslim.

Fyllikall,,,"Well...

I will put myself in the same role as you do and define what you are doing here is a form of propaganda.

Although we can all agree that people are being misled by a propaganda, that is subjectively everyone thinks they aren't misled and the opposing side is, it is generally good to remind people that propaganda is a fact of our daily lives.

But one cannot conflate propaganda with what is incorrect or what is correct. For instance we could propagandize the fact that intake of vitamin C combats scurvy (correct) but there are some that propagandize that the intake of massive amounts of vitamin C cures cancer (incorrect). So propaganda can be benign, that is to make sure that people remember to take their vitamins for good overall health or malicious in that it entices people to forgo other therapies for cancer. 

One thing that I dislike is the overall use of language policing which can be seen here. It is a form of debate when one who is not necessarily informed on the subject of the debate but uses his or hers knowledge of debate terms to combat every single statement made by the opposing side. 

To disseminate propaganda one can try to decipher if there are hidden messages within a statement, a post, advertisement etc.. For one, a post about propaganda from a ""neutral stance"" that references Wikipedia is a putting the message into an authoritative benign stance. If it were neutral then it would not take any side. When it states that an argument, in this case ""Israel is an Apartheid state"" is ad hominem form of propaganda the post itself becomes propaganda. By saying that I'm not saying that the aforementioned statement is correct or false since that has nothing to with it. But one could ask why this was the only example mentioned since we all know, regardless of stance, that the phrase ""Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism"" is mentioned ad hominem. This argument of mine could as well be combated as ""what-aboutism"", which is the overall problem we see here. The statements arent argued, they are only put into some categories.

Now if there was a clear cut argument against the case of Apartheid then you are not making it here. For one the definition of a race in the context of apartheid is not the one of some genealogy. The fact that there are different races and origins of Israelis is the same fact that there were different origins of white South Africans. There were also different origins of the black minority in that case. If I would say that Israel isn't an Apartheid state because some Jews come from Ethiopia then I would be saying that South Africa never had Apartheid because the whites came from all over Europe. 

Now if there wasn't the Rome statute with a legal definition of Apartheid then people would make some other general definitions. People and agencies are making the case of Apartheid because of the legal definition as you were pointed to. From there the argument becomes problematic because by the same standard one could say that law is for instance a ""black & white fallacy"" since either one is is guilty or not. There is also the case of what is loaded language or not, since our Lingua Franca, English, is horrible when it comes to creating new words for a specific reality. The words you mention, oppression and injustice for example, are too vague to describe the reality of what is happening within the West Bank. In the future a more specific legal term could be used for the situation in the West Bank if that helps people. 

Not pointed at you specifically but I want to add that every one of the points about forms of propaganda using the word apartheid can also be used for the statement ""Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism"".
It is a black & white fallacy, has an appeal aspect, is loaded language etc. 
I'm all for debating that notion and also talk about its propaganda use. What isn't helpful for anyone is for people use the fact that everyone uses propaganda as an argument either for or against the notion since that has no bearing of the truth of it or not.

Also if I can do some word policing, prejudice is not is not prejudgement of something based in history. Prejudice is having preconceived opinion not based on reason or experience... ""Emotion that has a history"" has nothing to do with it. People are also not prejudiced against discrimination, since most (if not all) people have experienced some form of discrimination and can therefore judge discrimination accordingly.

Sorry for the length of the post, I just had a problem with the way you propagated your point.",0,1719808061,,,0,lb2yx60,t3_1drfy9s,t1_lazhk3a,1719808076,1,False,IsraelPalestine,t5_2sgz7

This post's original body text:  

I have been living in my Lola’s house since I was 5 years old. She took care of me since yung parents ko nasa City kami nasa probinsiya. 

Lahat ng anak niya except kay papa naiwan dito sa bahay para may kasama siya. Bills are divided here. Electricity kanya while sa akin ang water and groceries weekly. My rent for space siya na sina papa ang nag mamanage. Though pinapangalan niya kay papa ang Business Permit sa kanya parin ang bayad ng renta. Si mama may maliit na carenderia.

Recently nagkasakit siya. Doctor said may bukol siya sa tyan which can lead to cancer daw. Di na pwede biopsy due to her age and maintenance na lang na gamot. 

She was suppose to go to Singapore kasama yung isang 2 na kapatid ni papa for vacation. Pero dahil nag kasakit siya at na confine ng matagal sa hospital na cancel. Yung mga kapatid ni papa nagalit because all has been paid na daw.

I know this post is turning into a rant but para lang clear ang picture. Hospital from our probinsiya is 1 hour away. The 2 siblings ayaw mag bantay. Ang isa US nurse that doesn’t like the hospital because “its pangit daw” not like sa “Yu esss”. Yung isa was busy partying and drinking because dumating yung college best friend niya from abroad.

Ang nag bantay kay lola is yung tita ko na asawa ng isa pang kapatid ni papa (hindi yung 2 na pupunta sana sa SG) since siya lang ang available. Di pwede sina mama at papa kasi may baby na ako and baka may madala silang sakit but everyday they drive papunta sa hospital. Mag dadala ng pagkain or kung ano kailangan. 

Nung nalabas na si lola sa hospital they decided without our knowledge na ilipat si lola doon sa bahay ng tita ko na nag bantay. Because ang sabi nung isa na “US NARS” napabayaan daw namin si lola. Agree naman yung lasingero. 

US nars spent most of her time here sa PH na nililibre friends niya from Highschool instead of spending time with my lola. Even used lola to pay for her hotels and expenses. The lasingero only visits to ask money.

Pasensya po if sobrang haba na.

Tanong ko po is if mawawala na po si lola and they decide to sell her house pero di pumayag si papa can they still sell it? Ang tittle is I believe naka pangalan pa sa mother in law ng lola ko. 

May bahay naman po kami pero naiwan kami kay lola para may kasama siya since ang totoo sila ang naging pabaya. Ayaw nila na ibalik si lola dito sa bahay.

If they sell the house wala naman kami magagawa. Akin lang yung memories na dito ako lumaki kasama si lola.

You had the privilege of not having to breathe that shit in under Chevron Deference. Now the Supreme Court, a conservative majority, says it can happen in your neighborhood - and it very well might. A third of that court was picked by Trump. 

You talk about a puppet - I'd suggest looking in the mirror and asking yourself why you'd support any policy that benefits any Fortune 500 corporation such as tax cuts for them, or tariffs that trickle down and cut into your hard earned pay check, and then ask why the Trump admin gave billions to corporations used for stock buy backs, but only gave you $1200 during COVID.",0,1719808129,,,0,lb2z1r4,t3_1ds46yj,t1_lb2n0u9,1719808144,1,False,millenials,t5_2xzp8
KlingonTranslator,zh,:Zurich: Zürich,"Our society has it that we _must_ drive to get to places. 

Nobody anywhere has to smoke. 

There’s no way we can soon hope to ban cars, but can focus on electric ones, sure! And yet there _are_ ways to incrementally ban public smoking. 
 
For health reasons I cannot drive, nor will never be able to drive. So, I have to take the trains. I wouldn’t mind because I like the environmental aspect of public transport, but the smoke causes me to wish so much that I could drive. I cannot drive due to seizures and other things, but at the same time cannot go a day in public without relatively heavy medication due to other people’s smoking. I suffer from migraines, and have to barter which days I can take the medicine on, as it cannot be used every day, or you get medication overuse headaches. 

Each inhale of some else’s exhaled smoke is no joke like a sucker punch to my forehead and then a daylong migraine, compounded with every new inhale. It’s honestly debilitating to have to deal with daily. Even if I’m outside on a seemingly empty platform, I know I’ll likely smell someone else’s invisible smoke soon waft into my face. 

[Tobacco smoke is among the top two risk factors for mortality](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-023-17421-w). 

People who consistently smoked an average of less than one cigarette per day over their lifetimes had a 64 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, and those who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes a day had an 87 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, [according to a new study from researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/low-intensity-smoking-risk)). 

64% higher risk than people (pretty much all of us) breathing in all the nasty car fumes is huge.",1,1719808261,,,0,lb2zamk,t3_1ds9260,t1_lb1jyrg,1719808276,3,False,Switzerland,t5_2qhp6

He supposedly murdered everyone in the world. Kids, elderly, everyone besides his favorite family. Burned two entire cities. Kids, elderly, everyone. That's a mass murdering psychopath, and you worship it. Defend it's mass murder because you're scared you'll be next.

>Those numbers alone cancel out any chance of being special. 

Why did you god only reveal himself to one group of people in a middle Eastern desert? That seems an awful lot like special treatment.

Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all.

spectredirector,,,"Stop. Stop and think. Joe challenged Trump to a debate - that was dumb, for a few reasons. (1) It elevated Trump, who is a convicted felon awaiting trial, and indicted on espionage charges currently - that's not a person you put side by side with any president for any reason. Biden was thinking about a comparison to Trump like you are thinking about a comparison to Trump.
 
Trump the sack of shit physical body and mind is NOT the reason Joe can lose. Joe can't lose if he's 20 years younger, the incumbency and a fuck up of epic proportions is a bad hole for a loved candidate. Biden is not loved, his popularity numbers have never gone up once since taking office, not really. And he saved democracy. So what gives? 
 
He's only got one flaw - and it's both literally and metaphorically fatal. 
 
He's TOO old. 
 
Now that's an opinion. It wasn't mine prior to Thursday, and his performance at the debates doesn't have me questioning the answer he gave to that question, it strictly has me questioning how long I've been denying truth to myself. 
 
Forget Trump was side by side to compare to our sitting president. 
 
Joe ""lost"" the debate he called for while acting with hubris he couldn't actually deliver on. That's what bullies do, we know that's not Biden, so we assume in good faith he just made a mistake and had a legit bad night. 
 
But what he did was appear like live action Abe Simpson. The hour was downhill, and he said ""we beat medicare"" - Trump landed the best zinger of the night - and I can't remember being more shocked by a thing. Sincerely the new thing this diehard Biden supporter learned about Trump was he was capable of making a decent joke. That's some wit, and some is more than Trump actually has. I know that. The idiot undecided doesn't. They saw a corpse and a man who could land a softball zinger on a stationary target. 
 
Biden lost epically because he fed the knock on him and went beyond it. He lost to plaque buildup and age related degenerative health. He's past life expectancy, and while Trump is too, Biden demonstrated it. When his only flaw, his fatal flaw - truly and honest with myself - is he looks geriatric. He moves like a fall risk. There's now video of him staring blankly and squinting, the word salad is Biden but now it's old, slow, raspy, noticeably old. The presidency ages young men. Trump is kept alive by evil magic, he'll outlive the tanning beds he gives cancer. Yes HPV. Yes, those tanning beds will be denied medical care in Texas. Trump will live until death proves its possible. Joe showed me what awaiting death looks like. He lost by himself to himself. 
 
The self own is so epic, that it needs an explanation better than pure incompetence. Biden didn't wanna lose 10 points in the polls in a weekend, no one thought there was a fallout as bad as this possible. And that's the thing - if that's what Biden knew the risk was, and he went thru with it and that was his best work possible. Well... We are only in good conscience voting against Trump. The morally correct and necessary thing. But we are hurting an old man doing it, we are enabling him, and he's not fit to be in charge. Trump is not only still around, but they just handed him more than Putin could. A democratic party with an incumbent president who just tanked the election and caused abject chaos in any certainty he's the nominee. 
 
That needs certainty. Yesterday. And there's only one way to do that when the knock is ""too old"" and the proof is the attack ads that debate will nickle and dime everything away from Joe from now until November. If Hillary had accidentally released incriminating emails by leaving them in a Denny's ladies room, and Mike Dukakis decided to wear them as a helmet while piloting an Apache attack helicopter, the noise Howard Dean would make has a better chance of ticking up in poll number then Biden does - between now and whenever he calls it quits. He showed his age, and his age is the problem. I think he nullified himself and the party knows it, Biden won't quit. It's turmoil, and the worst possible thing. 
 
Trump doesn't factor into any of that self own except he was standing on stage by Biden's request to reap all the benefits. 
 
Trump going to North Korea was gross, cuz he elevated a despot to the level of the US Presidency. 
 
Well....
 
Incompetence or age. Spectacular mistake. Historical. 
 
There's another debate scheduled. It's that simple. Joe goes on stage and isn't 25 years younger, well that's another big L in the side by side. And if Joe now bows out, probably the only option to not risk this again - well that's a loss, he's bailing after looking old. It's all loss. And the solution isn't readily available.

I think you guys are heading down a rough road. I know people married to an “unrealistic dreamer” and it can go several ways but what I typically see play out are variations of two scenarios:

1. (The good) The unrealistic dreamer accepts that their dream is more of a hobby. They do it in their *spare* time. Maybe their spouse makes enough so they can make it a “full time” hobby. But the goal is mostly personal enrichment and any money they make is seen as a bonus. The unrealistic dreamer is very present in the family and still contributing, albeit financially or with time/labour. 

2. (The bad) The unrealistic dreamer chases failed dream after failed dream. They drain the family’s financial resources into their doomed endeavors. They are usually absent from family life as they waste countless hours on their latest thing. Each failure compounds the pressure and the desperation for success. They are a massive drain on their family and basically everyone resents each other.

WalkableFarmhouse,,,"There were a lot of things over many years. The final straw wasn't even that big - the last attempt at reconciliation, she couldn't make it through an email without insulting me.

I suspect she couldn't handle contact with me at this point. A lot of her identity is built on trying to be better than me or, any problem I have, she has it worse.

Bagambe256,,,"As his follower on Patreon, this is the email I received on 30/6/2024

""Hi, this is Nina. I’m Kento’s wife (some of you may remember me from early Kento Bento videos). Kento needed assistance with writing and publishing this post (more on this later), so I wanted to be transparent about that. The following are his words:

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone. I missed you all.   


I know an update is long overdue, and I apologize for that. I hope this post clears a few things up.   


Let me address the Patreon situation first. During my extended break from YouTube, I have been pausing payments to ensure patrons aren’t charged, as I felt that I shouldn’t be accepting pledges if I’m not publishing videos. Unfortunately, Patreon doesn’t offer a way to *indefinitely* pause payments without taking down my page entirely, so I’ve had to log in and manually activate this function each month for the past couple of years. While this workaround isn’t perfect, it has mostly worked (barring the odd pledge slipping through).  


However, this month will be the first time I may not be able to pause payments as I will be undergoing invasive surgery. The healing process is expected to be lengthy, but I’m hopeful for a healthy recovery**.** Moreover, I’ve reflected on messages I’ve received from various patrons over the years who did not like my decision to pause payments. Their main concern was that it didn’t align with the concept of Patreon, where the choice to pledge should rest with the patrons. By repeatedly pausing payments, I was essentially taking away that choice.  


Taking all these factors into account, I’ve decided that I will no longer pause payments moving forward. I didn’t want to catch anyone off guard, so this is just a heads up for the months ahead.  


Secondly, I want to address my personal situation. I’ve heard some frustrations about the vagueness of the information I’ve provided regarding my extended break, and I completely understand. I’ve previously mentioned some of the health issues I’ve been dealing with, but there is one that I haven’t yet mentioned due to the uncertainty surrounding it. For the sake of transparency and to avoid any further confusion, I want to provide more details. I have been battling lung cancer for a while now, and it has taken up much of my time. Balancing this with caring for baby Sofia has been demanding. The coming months, in particular, will be unpredictable as I undergo intensive treatments and therapies, including the surgery I previously mentioned (which may have happened by the time this is posted).  


Despite everything, I am optimistic and look forward to getting through this. I’m very eager to put this chapter behind me. While I know these words may sound repetitive, I am committed to returning to making videos as soon as I am able. Your patience and understanding are deeply appreciated, and they keep me motivated to push forward.



Thank you for your ongoing support.



Take care,

dfinkelstein,,,"Add ""depression and anxiety"" to everybody else's answer who didn't include one already.
    
The frequency with which I read laundry posts if diagnoses with multiple labels which you by definition cannot be diagnosed with simultaneously is astounding. Or I guess not astounding at all when used by people to define themselves by a bunch of labels with limited use and dubious history and meaning.
       
Depression and ADHD both nearly always present with massive amounts of anxiety. You can't get diagnosed with ""anxiety"" in the first place. Everybody has ""anxiety."" 
    
There are anxiety disorders, and they each have a name.
      
I so often hear ""I have bipolar, depression--"" STOP. You cannot have both. It is meaningless to have both. There's a reason bipolar replaces a depression diagnosis. 
     
""I have OCD, generalized anxiety--"" nope. OCD is your anxiety disorder. It causes generalized anxiety. That's where your anxiety is coming from. From having one of the top ten most disabling illnesses bar none humans have. All illnesses. Cancer, diabetes, dementia, broken bones. OCD is one of the very worst of any kind. It makes no sense to tack on lesser anxiety disorders as well. It just makes no sense. 
      
And so on. 
     
People completely lose the plot on what these words mean. They mean very little, really. Your depression may have something or almost nothing to do with mine. The longer we go on using lists of words and making assumptions, the less time we spend actually understanding, communicating, and making sense. 
    
These words are STARTING points. Not ENDING points. They give you a heading for first line treatments. Contra-indicated treatments. Therapiest that might work. Ones that probably (*probably*) won't. Things other people who maybe had something similar tried. Ways to contact and meet them. People who helped them. Ways they helped. 
    
These words give you a heading. They don't fly your plane. You fly your plane. And you're the only one who can tell for sure if the heading you're flying is helping or hurting you. 
       
Just because you have ADHD, does not mean that any given stimulant will affect you a certain way. Almost no psychoactive drugs work that way. Just because you get manic on SSRIs or  antipsychotics cure your depression, doesn't mean you ""are bipolar.""
    
It's a useful idea to pursue. Hey, what if there's a word besides ""depression"" that might point me in a useful direction? Hmm. What does it mean, this heading? What does it suggest, predict, and explain? Does it make sense? FOR ME?
      
That's all we're doing with these words. Some are more testable and predictive and useful than others. We need SOMETHING to go on. To organize our treatments and research. Our drugs. And so on.
  
But guess what the most effective BY FAR treatments for EVERY mental illness EVER have always been? It's not antidepressants or Xanax or haldol or caffeine or nicotine or ozycotin.
   
It's not DBT or CBT or ACT or EMDR or Nos or fMRI or ABC.
    
It's the most boring obvious shit ever. It's diet, exercise, socializing, music, dance, movement, exercise, community, purpose, creating, expressing, connecting, imagining, experiencing, moving, exercising, and exercising. 
      
Does this cure diseases? Sometimes. Mostly, no. Pretty rarely. But it's more effective by leaps and bounds than any other standardized treatment regiments. It helps the most people the most and it's not even close. 
      
Which tells me what? That the words, the labels, will not save us. Because these interventions I'm gesturing at are universal. They're the same for everyone. And yet, everyone finds different help in different parts of those ideas. They find different paths to them and ways to access and experience and enact them. 
     
And drugs? Drugs are drugs. It's one thing. You take it or you don't. There's dose, and timing, and sometimes the formulation makes a difference, but usually not so much that it's going to change your life. But when you find enough of the other boring stuff that insurance companies can't charge for, then that can and does finish the puzzle and set you on the path to real wellness 
     
I don't know anyone who's been cured by drugs alone. They all have made changed to their lifestyle. They found purpose, meaning, belonging. Community. They changed their eating habits. Sleeping habits. They exercise. They socialize--passively, actively, whatever works. They find ways to practice thinking and solving problems. They journal. They find ways to express themselves. They meditate. They do yoga or Tai chi. They move. They swim or bike. They find meaning in small rituals. They build simple routines. They exercise. 
       
So what use are these labels? They can be used. They can make  the difference between life and death. They often do. 
    
But we mustn't forget what they are. ""diagnosis"" makes it sound like a type 1 diabetic who's twice nearly died from a coma and been resuscitated, and now has been prescribed insulin and can go on to live a largely uneventful unremarkable normal life.

I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.  I live a very simple life focused around family, friends and experiences.  It’s beautiful!",0,1719841803,,,0,lb4k4l4,t3_1dsqlkf,t3_1dsqlkf,1719841820,11,False,breastcancer,t5_2t6dy
Crosteppin,,,"Just my opinion, but I wouldn't take health advice from Tik Tok. 


There is zero science behind washed rice lemon water. Unless the pesticides that wash into the water are causing cancer leading to increased caloric intake. 


Lemons contain water and vitamin C. Neither of which stimulate weight loss. 


Rice water contains bugs, dirt and pesticides. Not reliable long-term strategy for weight loss. 


If you want to lose weight, try getting rid of saturated fats (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9312452/). Replace them with monounsaturated fats, such as are found in: nuts, avocados and fish oil. Then, increase protein intake at meals so that you feel more full and burn more calories (yes, more calories are burned when eating protein rich diets compared to fat rich diets https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10403587/).

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I’m making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I’ve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I’m in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60’s. I’d like to think that I’ve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo’s, one 14yo). It’s all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it’s a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won’t really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we’d have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we’ve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I’m very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don’t particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I’ve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I’ve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life…I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what’s the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They’ll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they’d have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

A global pandemic that was seriously mishandled by trump who completely disregarded the play book to handle such a situation because it was created by his predecessor. Because of his incompetence many people lost their jobs, and many others lost their lives. 

>Inflation through the roof

Inflation has been happening all over the world, not just the US. 

>Prices of everything are sky high while income isn’t up 

Why are you blaming the president instead of the corporations that are raising the prices of everything despite showing record profits? Speaking of income, which party keeps fighting against raising the minimum wage? It isn't the democrats.

>Medical supplies are at an all time high. Healthcare at all time high. 

And which party wants to tank the ACA and refuses to allow price negotiations on those supplies? Again - not the democrats. 

>Wants to get rid of tax cuts? What president says that lol? 

You mean the tax cuts that grossly inflated our deficit? 

>Embarrassment throughout the world. 

That was the other guy. 

>The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a national embarrassment and a shame on his part. 

That was negotiated by trump and scheduled to happen after he left office. 

>The mass funding of people’s wars is an embarrassment. 

Even more embarrassing is that trump knew putin was planning to invade a neighboring country and didn't say or do anything to discourage it because they're besties.

>Immigration worse than ever resulting in people being killed by immigrants on a DAILY basis. 

Illegal immigration is down. People are killed by other fully American citizens on the daily as well. 

>Not to mention the fact that he is cognitively gone. 

Right... like the gish galloping word salad trump spits makes a lot of sense. He completely failed to answer the questions he was asked during the debate, and his rants about being electrocuted by boat batteries and windmills causing cancer are lunacy.

First, this documentary:

- Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani (2020)

An ideal, a pioneer, an Albert Einstein or Alan Turing of hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry in mathematics, with an unbelievably inspiring story. She serves as an inspiration to numerous female students all over the world, and many awards are presented in her honor. Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani, a young woman who was honored with the Fields Medal (even while battling cancer, she didn't give up), won 2 gold medals at the International Olympiad of Mathematics, achieving a full mark! Scientists often describe her work as wielding a magic wand. Sadly, she passed away a few years ago at a young age due to cancer.

May 12, the International Women in Mathematics Day, marks the birthday of the award-winning mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani.

This documentary tells the story of her life, the education system, politics, etc. It doesn't capture the whole culture, but it highlights one of the main parts, especially the lives of teenagers (interviewed with students).

Directed by George Paul Csicsery. Filmed in Canada, Iran, and the United States.


Other options first shot:

- Interstellar 

The black hole simulation is currently part of some astronomy courses in some universities.""


Second shots:

- The Theory of Everything

They actively shadow ban anyone that won't comply as they are all in it together. 

Rockefeller started the American cancer society to do just that after his oil based ' medicine "" started giving people, you guessed it, CANCER. HE sponsored the medical community and flooded it with his henchmen to keep his profits flowing. Anyone that bucked the system was immediately labeled a quack and ostracized so voices were silenced. 


We are being played by the system, a system that pushes pills that treats but doesn't cure. They spend billions on advertising money that will be better spent on research. 

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

AlternativeFair2740,,,"‘I work as a peer supporter, so am I qualified?’ 

Well no - and that’s the problem? 

Women are not encouraged to breastfeed, they’re railroaded into it. Women are not allowed to be given support for formula feeding, or trained in administering formula feeding, by midwives, who are the actual trained people to advise, until a neonate is quite literally starving. Case in point - the feeding schedule noted above will include formula top ups, and still, the ‘perfect’ advice in this thread includes putting this exhausted, scared woman through feeding and then pumping. This lady has medical advice. She needs options that are beyond ‘the benefits’ of breastfeeding, which are status partly and evidentially minimal to none. 
Some vague notes on ‘childhood obesity’ and ‘prevention of cancers’ won’t cut it, especially when used by women who are happy to lecture on ‘evidence’ based practice. The evidence doesn’t exist, and you don’t need a ‘GCSE’ to read beyond shiny, biased leaflets in your doctors surgery, although I would hope that most people would ask for medical advice from someone with more than a level two day course in how to promote breastfeeding/ a GCSE. 

Women feel shit when they inevitably give up breastfeeding, and having the odd person battling through the emotional nonsense by stating repeatedly - formula feeding is fine, and a perfect replacement for breastfeeding, it’s important, regardless of whether they get swamped by women towing the line and shouting their ill informed options online. We need to remember that safe, sanitary bottle feeding ‘coincided’ with a drop in infant mortality from ONE IN THREE babies in the postpartum period. 

Perhaps you could analyse whether being a ‘breastfeeding peer supporter’ is the actual cause of the shame and upset women feel when they take the inevitable decision to stop feeding, rather than some inherent need to breastfeed that has magically appeared in modern times, contrary to the whole history of human praxis.",0,1719843635,,,0,lb4p1m8,t3_1dslhle,t1_lb4lf7z,1719843651,0,False,UKParenting,t5_iygqf

Powerful_Village2508,,,"I feel like working in the medical field makes it all so easy to get worked up and panicky over increases in cancer and heart disease and environmental carcinogens (as well we should, I agree, since those are the problems at hand) that we totally overlook the sheer volume of children who died before the age of eight as recently as 100 years ago. Or the women who died giving birth. Or all the people, men, women, and children alike, who died of infections/illnesses that cheap, readily-available antibiotics can cure in 5-14 days nowadays. 

It’s easy to catastrophize when you’re faced with something what seems like all day every day. We all do it. But what drives this thinking is that humans simply don’t have the life expectancy to put and keep things in the proper perspective that would let you truly see that “if it’s not one thing it’s another.” But it’s true. And I think it’s really important for one’s sanity, if anything, to remember that we’re really not doing that bad overall. Everything is a trade off. At least that’s how I see it. 

The US is kind of a special case in terms of environmental protections because what flies and what doesn’t environmentally is likely to be decided by a patchwork of states and not consistently by any sort of federal authority (true even before the repeal of Chevron, to an extent, though of course that decision will make things worse) and that makes it harder for everyone to get on the same page. Not to mention our healthcare system is spotty as hell and remains unaffordable for lots of Americans despite the ACA, depending on what state you’re actually in. And we NEED to fix that. 

But I’m still comforted by the fact that I’m more likely to die of (perhaps environmentally-caused) cancer in 25 years than of rabies in like 3 weeks, statistically.",0,1719844854,,,0,lb4shhr,t3_1dspznz,t1_lb49tpz,1719844871,7,False,nursing,t5_2ra72
vagueink,,,"Correct, the digestive tract isn’t 100% efficient so your previous statements about calories in/calories out are quite empty. You asked where the energy went. I told you, now you seem to be co-opting my point. Energy in doesn’t always mean energy out and carbohydrates are the effective energy mechanism…not protein in reasonable doses and not fiber in any dose. Point made hopefully.

Functional medicine definitely isn’t quackery and has cured more serious issues personally and within my rather large circle than conventional medicine. I’ve seen it put autoimmune disorders and cancer into remission and at present it’s the best hope for curing ALZ. The white wolf of conventional medicine. There’s a reason why the richest among us have abandoned conventional medicine when looking at life extension and innovation in the field of medicine and why very little of it is being done in heavily regulated western countries. My basic guess is that conventional medicine and by extension conventional research has been co-opted by capitalism and then kneecapped by regulation. Share holders, political lobbyists and university endowments influencing medicine is a horrible blend of idiocy. It’s great you’ve picked a noble field but my guess is you won’t innovate much until you wake up from conventional thought. I hope you prove me wrong but it’s more likely you just keep pushing the rock up the hill looking for the magic pill that cures a lack of mindfulness in the masses. 

If you are unwilling to receive my anecdotal lead (your words) I’ve presented you and instead use a fairly shallow Wikipedia post to attempt to make your point, then I believe my original reply holds true. You should experience for yourself rather than just read. It’s not hard to fast. You’re a researcher, research for real. Also, as a researcher you should be ashamed for using Wikipedia as a source. Give Dr Dale Bredesen a read if you want a nice introduction into what functional medicine actually means.

Detoxing isn’t a myth, that’s absurd, it’s simply a term used to encompass a process used to encourage the elimination of unwanted things in the body. I’ve experienced it first hand as have many of my circle and millions around the world. Ours  definitions might differ but a simple example (by my definition) would be the use autophagy to eat cancer cells and dispel toxic waste. Conventional medicine uses radiation and now designs vaccines to cure cancer while the mechanism to clean the body of unwanted cellular growth is as simple as letting itself, eat itself. Why wouldn’t this be shared with NPCs? Because there’s not much money in telling people who suffer from chronic issues to just stop eating carbohydrates. Full circle.

I really hope you never have to experience the major limitations of conventional medicine/research yourself but if you do I hope you remember this post and mix it up a bit. It might save your life or the life of someone you really love in such a simple way. 

Feel free to launch more things you’ve read on the internet but never experienced for yourself at me. It won’t sway my wisdom but it will make my point.

Secret_Box5086,plain,Non-denominational,"It was compromise agreement between city officials, the Pride Month people, and the Cancer Survivor's Month people.

The city had already committed to a ceremonial start with the mayor to launch Pride Month and to display Pride Month banners downtown through the entire month. However, the Cancer Survivor's Month group wanted the same thing. The mayor's schedule could not accommodate that and there was no room for two sets of banners.

So, the agreement was to launch Pride Month on June 1st and keep it up through yesterday (June 30th). 

The Pride banners came down overnight and the Independence Day banners (which would have normally went up this past Saturday) are already up. They will stay up the normal 9 days until July 9th.

There will be a launch of ""June is National Cancer Survivors Month"" on July 10th and banners go up then and will stay up 30 days.

No group was totally happy with the agreement but both observances get equal treatment. 

The city wanted to declare July Cancer Survivor's Month for the city but the response was that its either tied to the national observance or nothing. The Pride Month people objected to the observance being called ""June is National Cancer Survivors Month"" but their objection was dismissed. There was also hesitation to drag June into August but the city didn't want to appear insensitive to cancer victims and conservatives on the city council said that they would move to cancel Pride Month if the Survivor's Month wasn't given equal treatment.",0,1719846705,,,0,lb4xwb4,t3_1dsrinc,t1_lb4v5vp,1719846721,1,False,Christianity,t5_2qh6c
