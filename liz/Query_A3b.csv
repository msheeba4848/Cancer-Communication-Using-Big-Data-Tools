Street_Hedgehog_9595,cath,Catholic,"To win, you need to make it your number one goal to put God first. I might sound harsh, but you need to be actually serious about this. If this were some competition to win 1,000,000 dollars if you didn't have sex again before marriage, do you think you'd do better? If yes, then you have a lot of work to do. And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God‚Äôs grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. ‚ÄúI can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.‚Äù (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. ‚ÄúAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.‚Äù (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.

twigg2,,,"I work at a tanning salon and have been a member as well for years. Definitely depends on genetics, if you have skin sensitivity or family history of skin cancer or other skin conditions it can influence your likeliness, obviously. But that being said, using quality products that are sold at the salons is going to help so so much with any aging or skin damage potential. Do not get tanning products from like Walmart or Amazon or anything because you need a certain certification to carry quality products that will decrease your chances of skin conditions or damage and brands like Target, Walmart, etc do not have that certification so the brands they are selling are probably not 100% real! Also don't over do it. Don't force yourself to tan for a longer time than your body can actually handle. I always say don't go up in time in a bed until you don't get any pink or red undertones! 
Another important key is it depends on what bed you use. Most tanning salons have different bed levels and the lowest bed is the cheapest for a reason. It's a lower pressure bed but usually is super high in UVA rays which are the rays that burn you. If you can at least do a step up from this bed your chances of aging and skin damage will be lower because there will be a balance of UVA and UVB (UVB are bronzing rays so gives you the color you're looking for without a high likeliness of burning)! Also the higher pressure the bed, the less maintenance to keep the tan so you don't need to go in every single day!

Finally, I also recommend an extender lotion. This is a lotion you will replace with Aveeno or Bath and Body Works lotions and it helps extend the length of your tan. A really good one is Hemps Australian Gold because it has Derma Dark in it, which helps develop a tan and adds color! Apply these after showering or at the end/beginning of the day! Products like this will help you reduce maintenance as well!",0,1719792429,,,0,lb1zm59,t3_1ds6dds,t3_1ds6dds,1719792445,3,False,tanning,t5_2txyd

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that¬† the doctors who have no¬† interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.¬† With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list¬† and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.¬† It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.¬† The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.¬† The LDN tablets she was taking¬† were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.¬† Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.¬† My own medical cabinet is quite empty now!¬†



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and¬† residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.



I think your questions are excellent and would be appreciated at the LDN RT Webinars.¬† Whatever questions are not answered during the webinar are answered on the LDNRT You Tube site,

Dijon2017,,,"I‚Äôm sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient‚Äôs and cancer‚Äôs responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It‚Äôs not clear how ‚Äúthe nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit‚Äù. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient‚Äôs subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient‚Äôs cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it‚Äôs entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother‚Äôs complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

This is not to imply that you have indicated medical malpractice given the limited information provided in your post. Your post is devoid of important information that most competent physicians and med mal attorneys (who use medical experts) need to help offer you an opinion if you could have a viable case.",0,1719793582,,,0,lb22dqv,t3_1ds5dxe,t3_1ds5dxe,1719793599,4,False,MedicalMalpractice,t5_3ejbc

My mom's family had a big fight about 15 years ago because of an inheritance. The main fight was between my mom and dad on the one hand, and my aunts Lorna and Missy on the other hand. The specific cause of the fight is not relevant to this post, but had something to do with pieces of land that were given to some family members before my grandmother's passing and how to count their value. After this fight, a few attempts for reconciliation were made, to no avail. This was all more than 10 years ago. There was no contact with Lorna or Missy ever since. My other aunts Ally, Maeve and Ginny never took a side and are still in touch with both 'parts' of the family.

Five years ago, my mother passed away after she had cancer for 6 months. Lorna and Missy never contacted her while she was ill, but did visit her in the hospital during her last week (when she was not lucid anymore). They did come to the funeral, but did not speak to me. I found it very sad that they never made up while my mom was still alive. We have not been in touch since. 

Now, one of Lorna's daughters organises a BBQ and invited the whole family, including us. I was unsure whether to go, since I got a baby 5 weeks ago and it might be too busy for the baby. I also don't want to leave my baby alone yet.  However, I wanted to go as I saw it as an attempt for reconciliation. 

After a talk to my dad, I decided not to go. He pointed out that none of the estranged family members have congratulated me for the birth of the baby. Also, they have never apologised or said their regrets for not making up while my mom was still alive. He made it clear that it would hurt him if I would go to this party, because I would prioritise the estranged family over seeing him more frequently after having the baby. I do see him once a week, but he would like that to be more often. 

Now, I want to skip the party to not hurt my dad. Would I be the asshole to my estranged family?

Earnestappostate,no-knight,Ex-Theist,"> I couldn‚Äôt (and still can‚Äôt) why god would give my mom cancer and let her die

I also can't see why a good and just God would do this. One of the biggest issues that I had with my faith was the degree of suffering allowed in the world. It didn't mesh with a powerful God that could prevent it.

I never experienced too much suffering, the standard set: unrequited love, various bumps and bruises, but not really anything that made me question my faith, but I knew others had suffered and died horribly and it troubled me.

>After that I‚Äôve started to think I‚Äôm an atheist but it‚Äôs so scary to me not to believe in a god. 

Carl Sagan, when asked where that leaves us (if God doesn't exist), responded, ""on our own."" And being on our own and responsible for our own survival is pretty scary. Especially when one had been accustomed to the thought of an overseer who could keep us safe from everything. 

Coming to the realization that you don't think that is true can, for some, feel freeing, but for others it is terrifying. I don't envy you your path if this is scary for you, it likely means you have a worldview to construct from scratch, and that is hard work.

floopyk28,,,"When I was at school, I had a friend ""Jake"" who all year had been complaining of a bad foot. Hed attended various doctors all were all very dismissive, typical teenage lad who played too much football or had growing pains type of thing. A few months after finishing school we all had to go back and collect certificates, noone had spoken or seen Jake since school finished which was really strange. A teacher told us all that during the last week of school, it was discovered he had bone cancer in his ankle after his mum paid to get private physio sessions, he didn't tell anyone as he didn't want to ruin the last week of school or make anyone worry. 
The teacher broke major laws in telling us, however the entire friendship circle rallied and made his last months the most memorable we could. He died just 3 months later. 

Until then, we'd all thought of cancer as a grown up illness. I'd known a young girl at church who had cancer as a child, but for some reason, being a teenager felt like some weird area of cancer free years.

I left school in 2008, and since then a further 7 people from my year group have died of cancer in that time frame. None of them made 30. Several more have battled cancer, or their partners are.

When we rescued her we were told she was great with other pets with children and with people. Housebroken the whole nine yards

Her first night she ate through the mattress I was sleeping on. A few months later she bit a stranger at a dog park (a dog park we could only go to if there were no other dogs present because she was highly dog reactive) 

Next up was her busting her head open on a kennel while she was at the vet to work on her anxiety 

After that was tearing out a one of her k-9s on her kennel. (The kennel we removed to door on because she hated being trapped anywhere) 

She bit my wife she bit me a few times because of food aggression. 

Multiple multiple vets trying to train her behavior all the drugs in the book just trying to find something that worked including my wife working from home and it did nothing. 

And last year she finally just calmed down. No more issues. Maybe a few messes in the house every now and then whatever compared to how she was we thought she finally accepted us as family. 

Then about a month ago (we‚Äôve had her since 2018) she suddenly died. Stopped eating we took her to the vet after her second day of refusing meals. They thought it might have been constipation so they kept her locked up in a kennel for a week getting her healthy. When I went to pick her up I thought all was well except for her living conditions as she was literally covered in shit from her waist back. 

Got her home cleaned her up and she was good she was eating again going to the bathroom again. And was dead the next day. 

Turns out she had cancer on her liver this dog goes to the vet for checkups every three months. And no one caught it. Had it for quite a while. (probably when ever she calmed down) vet didn‚Äôt catch it put her through hell for her last days on earth 

So if I had put her down earlier she would have been saved from a slow and painful death.

I was 59, she was 84, and almost the *very last words* ***ever*** to me were ""you always thought I was a terrible mother!"" 

Gee mom, make the end of your own life horrible and blame it on your kids. Par for the course with her. I actually laughed at her saying that. 

Dear OP, your mother is not going to change. People as toxic and full of poison *just don't.* They'll spew venom on their deathbed.

You *have* made a success of your life in attaining a good partner and two fine children. Your mother is trying to ruin that for you because *her* life is one big fail.

Spoilers warning.

For example, Don Draper is in crisis when the show begins. He is a phenomenal salesman who until now could sell anything. But he has found that what he must do now -- sell cigarettes  -- is a doomed task, because people are now aware of the truth that cigarettes are cancerous and that big tobacco has been lying to them for decades. Nothing he says can counter the facts, now that the truth has come out. It is a moment of deep crisis for him, because he has built his life around selling the idea of himself based on lies and hiding truths, just like how those tobacco companies built their businesses. The truth is destined to come out eventually, even if it takes years, and one day people will become aware of the truth about him too, and he will no longer be able to convince anyone of his lies. 

Similarly, in the Sopranos, Tony is the head of an italian crime family. Culturally, your loyalty is supposed to be to the family as a collective, and the good of that collective is supposed to be above everything else. But it turns out that his family (his mother) is the one who wants him dead, because she believes he is bad for their family. So what do you do when ""everything you do is for the good of the family"", yet your family has decided that your death is thing that is best for them?  
He is also a psychopath who uses therapy not to resolve his own issues, but to learn how to manipulate and harm others better, which is obviously the opposite of how it is supposed to work.

We also have to consider that recordkeeping in terms of cancer identification, diagnosis, treatment, and cause of mortality are also fairly recent in human history; I'm 34 and I really only have reliable family history data to look at back to the later years of my grandparents. If they didn't tell me about any cancers they had earlier in their lives, it's unlikely that I would be able to find out about them.

So if you don't have a history of a certain type of cancer that women get in your family, it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't or won't occur! It's possible that it was passed down from your father, that it was obscured in past recordkeeping practices, or that people have just gotten lucky in terms of MSH6 cancers in your family!

MSH6 also seems to be one of the ""less bad"" types of LS, with lower overall risks of cancers relative to MSH2 and other types of LS (but still greater, and for certain cancers significantly greater, than the risk for someone without LS). I inherited MSH6 from my mom, and we think we inherited it from her father who died of brain cancer at 72 (but had not had cancer prior to that). Our extended family members took tests as well, and maternal grandfather's sister found out she has MSH6 too. Her first cancer was found when she was in her 80s! But meanwhile my mom (66) has been one of the not-so-lucky people with MSH6, and is currently recovering from her 4th cancer.

You can‚Äôt compare treatment to prophylaxis. As the others have mentioned she likely needs the chemo to shrink the tumor before a mastectomy would be the most successful. It depends on the stage of the cancer and how aggressive it is too. Not to mention if she has any preexisting conditions that would impact her ability to do well with surgery. My grandma for example was not a candidate for a mastectomy even though we all pushed for it, her heart couldn‚Äôt handle it. She had to do multiple courses of chemo to shrink her tumor then have the lumpectomy. 

And I‚Äôm sure Angelina probably paid out of pocket for most of it. Insurance does cover it to an extent now if you‚Äôre BRCA positive, which I‚Äôm actually going to get tested for bc I want to get a double mastectomy before I get it too.

In hindsight, it's foundation had sunk into the ground significantly compared to neighboring buildings. We knew we were in for a rough time because of close calls with the Memorial and Tax Day floods, so we elevated everything that wouldn't fit on counter-tops at least 2 ft above the ground. That didn't matter as we had 3 to 4 feet of water in our unit when it was over. We grabbed our pet and essentials and evacuated upstairs, knocking on doors until someone let us in. That person was a professor from Rice and they saved us and fed us. An absolutely wonderful person. After the rain cleared we tried to leave the complex but it was too dangerous. A UH student had a kayak or something and he ferried the elderly to dry land. That absolute legend probably saved lives. At some point a helicopter came to rescue the most vulnerable from atop the parking garage. I remember working with several people to keep the metal garage roof from being ripped off due to the helicopters wind.

Cleanup a week later was the worst part. The smell was awful even with laboratory grade masks on, and I think it had long term damaging effects (I was diagnosed with cancer and asthma a little over a year later).

Not sure how you handled it with her, but when my wife went to Hospice, we chose to celebrate every moment. We brought in balloons and celebrated birthdays, Christmas, and our Anniversary (she surprised me and had them put her in a special dress). Played music all the time. Sometimes ordered in nice food (Red Lobster). Invited friends and family to visit during specific times. I slept there for the full 25 days she fought. When she couldn't eat solid food anymore, I brought her things like Booster Juice in her favourite flavour, as well as Starbucks tea. Got her some silly toys (plastic clapping hands from the dollar store that she liked to bop me with) as her motor skills were diminishing.

While I've been through a loss, I can't imagine 2. Our son is my link to my wife.
Spend time with him and talk - my biggest regret, I was too focused on meeting needs and getting friends and family in. See if you can find some things that smell like him and store them in a sealed bag. 3 years later, I found some tissue paper (from presents) that smelled like her still; I've since stored them. I have some vacuum sealed clothes I'm going to have a quilt made from someday. With her ash (we used Aquamation, similar to cremation, but more environmentally safe), we had a small urn to keep, necklaces that held ash for a few of us, a few glass oil lanterns with her ash in the glass, as well as glass ""touchstones"" we could carry with us. There was still a very large volume of ash to distribute in Moraine Lake near Banff, Alberta, per her request. Maybe discuss something like this with him so you can hang onto something. A company also took a fingerprint and have products we had etched on glass, and the Silver necklaces.

Get him to help plan his celebration of life if that's the intent. We were kind of stuck with Covid restrictions, but we made a video for a few to come watch, and put it on YouTube too. She chose the music and some of the pictures it cycled through. She didn't want a ""program"", so we made custom envelopes with her picture on it, as well as fridge magnets (VistaPrint). Her thing was butterflies so I found an Etsy store that had butterfly shaped paper with impregnated seeds of flowers that draw them.

JadeGrapes,,Parent,"Headsup, If shame could fix things, you would already be better... So logically, it's not a lack of shame that is keeping you sick. 

So you should stop trying to use shame to motivate yourself. It's just not useful for that.

In my experience, Depression makes you feel like not doing anything. So a decent point, is to NOT use for feelings to dictate what you do.

There is a pretty smart Harvard Psychiatrist with a Youtube, called ""Healthy Gamer"" one of his videos talks about students that struggle to study...

His advice is that they don't need to try and trick themselves into wanting to do XYZ. Instead, you need to train yourself into doing things based on time versus feelings.

Essentially, Set a timer for 20 minutes and do XYZ immediately. Then when the timer is up, you set a time for your break. Even if you FEEL like you want to keep going to ride the momentum. You still take your break. The clock is the decider, not your feelings.

Over time, you can build up the muscle of discipline to do what needs doing, regardless of how you feel.

My mantra for this is ""You don't have to dig it, to do it""

Try some radical acceptance for your illness; if you had Cancer... you wouldn't be shitting on yourself for staying home or not seeing friends. Depression can be as deadly as cancer, so take that shit seriously. ACCEPT you have an illness, and you are currently on some sick days.

For myself, when my depression ""flares"", I make sure to take my meds, get right amount of sleep, take a daily shower, brush my teeth, eat reasonable amounts of food, take some vitamins, use my SAD light, get 15 mins if exercise (even if it's just stretching)... then cut myself some slack... everything after that is gravy.

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don‚Äôt how to explain this info, but here‚Äôs something. 

I have a different ailment, that I‚Äôve found great success with , and I‚Äôm coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it‚Äôs conditionally essential. In children it‚Äôs much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It‚Äôs also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it‚Äôs top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn‚Äôt scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn‚Äôt scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone‚Äôs comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‚Äòautoimmune‚Äô diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it‚Äôs called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it‚Äôs implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in ‚Äúglobal protein metabolism‚Äù when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability. 

It came to me almost like a soft impulse. I googled LONG COVID TAURINE and the first thing that comes up is this, 

https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2023/10/researchers-identify-amino-acid-that-may-play-key-role-for-predicting-treating-long-covid.html.

I mean taurine isn‚Äôt even in the title. There‚Äôs something here, it‚Äôs super cheap to supplement. Studies have shown use of up to 6g a day. It‚Äôs in red meat. It‚Äôs in breast milk. I also has lots of other effects and is knock out for cardiovascular health. Just take it, let the community know how it went. This could be promising and if you‚Äôre wondering why they didn‚Äôt think of this sooner, it‚Äôs very recently this mechanism of taurine is new found.",0,1719798659,,,0,lb2eml0,t3_1dsbyo2,t3_1dsbyo2,1719798676,2,False,covidlonghaulers,t5_2wizt3

kaylintendo,,,"I would honestly be shocked. I think my cutaway point would be 25; I wouldn't feel concerned, suspicious, or judgmental of a guy who was 25 and still a virgin. But over 25; I'd definitely feel some type of way about it. I'm not saying everyone needs to lose their virginity in high school, or even in college. I'd just be very surprised that they were still a virgin in the years after leaving college.

If I was in my 30's and in the dating field again, I think those feelings would be exacerbated. At that point, I would be concerned at what his reasons might be. 

I would wonder if he remained a virgin for religious reasons; if so, as an atheist, I'd be turned off. 

I might wonder if it was because he was asexual, or if he was the type to only want sex after marriage (without any religious influence; I've met a few guys like that) which are turn offs as someone who does find sex to be an important component in relationships.

If it was neither of those reasons, I'd wonder if he had some kind of tragic event in his life that I might find sympathetic or understandable. Like if he was diagnosed with testicular cancer earlier in his life and developed an insecurity over having sex. Or, if he was the sole caretaker for an elderly/ill family member, and decided it was best to put off dating and relationships to prioritize them.

If there wasn't something reasonable or understandable like that, I'd wonder if the guy has something seriously messed up with him. Is there some type of criminal past that automatically turns women away? Is he abusive? 

Even if the issue was severe social anxiety or some other emotional-based issue, I feel like that's deeply concerning for a 30+ year old man to have. I do expect dating partners in their 30's to be over that kind of shit. Your 20's are for stumbling around, fucking up, and learning how to be a mature adult. If you haven't sorted your stuff out by your 30's, I think it's fair to say that there's a high chance you never will. 

I had a friend in college who was in his 30's, but as I got to know him more, I realized that he was a massive manchild. He did things like creep on college-aged girls while married with kids (to the point where he actually had a Title IX investigation), sold his car and cashed his 401k in order to fund a months-long trip to a foreign country, hold immense resentment for not being elected President for student government, and so on. I gave up on trying to reason with him, and to this day, he still believes he was always in the right, even in the situation where a girl reported him to the Title IX office. I am confident that he will always be that way. When someone is in their early 20's, maybe even mid 20's, I do think there is a good chance for someone to be able to see the error of their ways and ""grow up."" I think those chances are really slim for someone in their 30's.

I understand there are plenty of people who decide to put off dating in order to focus on school or their career for a while, but I'd personally be weirded out if someone decided to wait until they entered their 30's to start dating/having sex. I don't miss the experience of being someone's first girlfriend, and I certainly wouldn't want to deal with it when I'm in my 30's.

I was my ex's first relationship, and he was also a virgin. Although we were much younger (early to mid 20's) I still  ran into a lot of roadblocks because of that difference.

Neuman didn't just kill the sheep because she needs to see his target to pop them, and as we saw on season 3, she needs more time if they have V, so while she was popping one sheep, the other three could just tear her apart.

3 supes + the rest of the boys did kill all the sheep and came out on top, by hiding when they where in a disadvantage and coming up with a plan with the resources available, the one dose of the virus. Annie is shown to be having problems with her powers. And Kimiko could maybe do something better, but the goal wasn't to kill the sheep it was for the whole team to survive.

Stan was great but his role in the story it's just not villain, he has his own agenda, clearly. I think it's more that we get to know the character instead of him being softer. 

How is the pardon an asspull when it's the price to pay for a chance to not get your head popped off? I think it was a pretty easy desicion for Dakota Bob. 

>  
I really have trouble to perceive him or Neumann even as Villain at this point.

Neumann, the same character that's considering killing the president to become president herself in alliance with homelander in order to take over the country? that's hard to see as a villain? 

  
Stan's just not a villain as I said before. He's a horrible person looking out for his own interests.

>  
Similar with Neumann who honestly should have killed everyone at the barn. The chicken, sheep, the Boys and even Stan Edgar and she would have gotten rid of a lot of her troubles.

Why would she want to ruin all her plans by getting exposed to the public as a murderous supe?

>The Boys themselves unfortunately are becoming annoying imo, Frenchie and Starlight are completely useless and are even negative for the team.

A character being usless to the efficiency of the team does not mean that they're bad for the story being told.

>starlight is extra annoying bitching at butcher all the time while fucking everything up herself and frenchies neverending guilt is just tiresome. MM is just boring at this point and Butcher works best alone or in duo teamups. The only one really developing is hughie.

Annie has a right to feel down because everything she's built is falling apart, talking shit to the man who would kill every superpowered person in the world if he could makes sense. If she's going through a hard time that's because the story demands it, I don't agree with all execution there is a reason for everything.

Frenchie's guilt also makes sense but in my opinion it could be handled better, still to say he's not having development is wrond, he's learning to take responsability for his past wrongs and how to move forward as a person.

MM is kind of light right now but not everyone needs to be ready to explode all the time. He's finally being a better leader by calming Annie and Butcher at the farm by knowing what  to say to them.

Although we didnt really do more than like a minute because those ducts release a miniscule amount and it gets a bit dull after a bit. After nursing the small beast all day im not going to go into that mode for what is supposed to be my relaxation and entertainment time. So do what feels ok for you as well. 

Also, after your adult play sessions, try to wipe off your nipples with a wet cloth. Or at least before the child latches on (but that's more difficult, immediately after sexual play was easier for me). You dont want oral infections passed if there are any. 

I went with extended breastfeeding and weaned off fully at 2.5 years. By the end it was just night feeds.

OpinionsMineAlone,,,"I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through that. I‚Äôm a male in my mid 50‚Äôs and there is no one my age who hasn‚Äôt been affected by breast cancer - be it themselves, family, or close friends. My mom went through stage 4A a few decades ago when I was too young to understand the gravitas of the situation.  I was living half a world away (left home at 17, got the news when I was around 22).  She protected me from the full truth - as moms do. I thought a mastectomy would  take care of everything. Had I known the reality of the chemo, radiation, surgeries, I would have come back home to offer whatever pitiful support I could. It wasn‚Äôt until some of my close friends went through similar situations that she opened up to me on how hard it really was. 

I wish I had something soothing,or poignant to say, but I don‚Äôt. The only advice I can give is to trust your family and friends - let them know how hard it is and if they‚Äôre willing to help LET THEM - and don‚Äôt feel guilty about it.

DeliciousKBHoney,,,"I'm a Pisces sun, cancer moon, Aquarius rising.
My partner is a Sagittarius sun Taurus moon. We have no major issues. 
My brother is a Cancer sun with a Sagittarius sun female. They also have gone the long haul with no chance of slowing down. 
Both my brother and myself have placements in our charts that make us independent and ever so slightly detached. I think Sagittarius needs that. I'm not clingy, he's not clingy...we both can handle sag bluntness. If you focus on finding someone who can handle bluntness and give you independence....you should be able to make any sign work. 

I recommend a channel on YouTube called soul navigation. She doesn't do sun focused astrology. It's evolutionary astrology; which looks at the whole chart. She has a few great series on finding your soul mate. She also discusses golden linkages.... which are a part of magi astrology. If you have even 1 golden linkage a relationship is highly likely to succeed. My husband and I have 4 I think. We almost never argue, it's still fun and spontaneous (not boring )but we were very intuitively attuned from day one. 
We went on one date and got married. Literally everyone though we had gone insane but we've been together and happy for almost two decades! 

I think something else that's important to think about is finding someone with compatible attachment styles. Independent signs like Sagittarius should avoid people who have insecure attachment styles or abandonment trauma...it's just going to create a lot unnecessary problems. Basically you'll end up feeling suffocated and they'll feel unloved. I'd recommend looking up the signs of a secure attachment (no major childhood trauma) to help you find a match with low friction.

Mom has been ill for a few years with rheumatoid arthritis. My family has been quite dysfunctional and with a lot of problems. Mom got sued by the municipality because she stopped paying rent and eviction was imminent, brother got diagnosed with cancer and passed a way. I came back from abroad and lived at my mom‚Äôs for a while but it was full of conflict and problems. Got kicked out of her house once. My mental health was deteriorating, I was working for a call centre and doing a lot of commuting. Whenever I‚Äôd get home there would be no rest because my was always shouting and calling for my brother to help her with this and that. At this time, eviction was still imminent. I was back living with her and my brother but the environment and energy was not right. Despite all of that, I started talking to my mom about finding a place to live and that any time they could knock and we would be out on the streets. She told me she was not going to live with me. I found a flat and got my brother to come and see it. We agreed we would split the deposit for the house. I pay the deposit in advance because I don‚Äôt want to lose the house. My brother than turns around and tells me he‚Äôs going to live with mom and my sister (whom I don‚Äôt have a relationship with). I confronted my
mom and she told me ""i told you i was not going to live with you"".  So i was stuck with a flat, and very little money. I had to get over the heartbreak, betrayal and confusion and find w flatmate, which i did. 

Almost a year goes by and mom is still living with my siblings at the house they were meant to be evicted from. they get the last eviction notice and my mom calls me and tells me she needs to talk with me. i told her theres's nothing to talk about, i'm moving to another place to be closer to work and im giving the key to the flat soon. i will be living with a flatmate and there is no space for her.

a few months go by and i find out mom, brother and sister bought a house together. the house is in my sister's name, my mom gave her 10k, and my brother got a loan from the bank so they could have enough deposit. They moved in together and things go left very quickly. My mom needs a lot of support, sister and brother are ignoring her and don‚Äôt help her with anything. Sister threatens to kick my mom out all the time. Mom is sinking in depression. Calls me all the time crying. Sister decides to renovate house so the three of them have to move out for 2 months. 

In the meantime, I got new job, higher salary, flatmate moved out and I‚Äôm living alone in a nice apartment. Mom has asked to move in with me, I told her that‚Äôs not happening because my boyfriend at the time was meant to move in with me. We have now broken up. Family members are calling me telling me I should take my mom in. 

AITA for not wanting her to move in after everything that has happened? Especially after they let me put  a 2k deposit down?

I‚Äôm not a medical professional, so I‚Äôm just speaking from my own experience, but I think the risk of it progressing to actual cancer is pretty low. That said, it‚Äôs definitely worth taking seriously. The thing about autoimmune disorders is that you can manage the symptoms but it never really goes away. Once your body has learned to attack itself, it doesn‚Äôt just stop. 

The first place to start healing for your sister is learning about LP, understanding what her triggers are, reducing stress, improving sleep and beginning the work of healing her gut. It can be really overwhelming, especially when you‚Äôre already stressed and tired, so your sister is lucky to have you!

I‚Äôve posted a few links in other comments in this sub, so you might look for those too, but I definitely recommend the book The Paleo Approach and the author‚Äôs website The Paleo Mom as a good place to start learning about LP and autoimmune disorders. Figuring out the right diet has been a multi year process, so it‚Äôs important to remember that it took a long time to get sick and it can take a long time to get better. 

Western medicine isn‚Äôt going to have a lot of good answers for her about causes or treatments, so it‚Äôs also important to educate yourself and be willing to advocate for treatments options that do more than address symptoms (I.e topical steroids, immune system suppressants, mouth washes, etc)

Flufferfluff,,,"WARNING: SEXUAL INDECENCY, GRIEF



Not saying goodbye to my grandfather who passed of cancer last year. On the day of his passing, I witnessed a crime of sexual indecency (A male customer came in m\*sturbating and he stared at me while doing so before leaving. Couldn't report it, though, because he left too quickly for my manager to hunt him down and report him to the police) while I was working at the airport as a cashier, which REALLY left me feeling disgusting. 



I remember crying while telling my family, and though they tried to comfort me, they couldn't, because my grandfather was dying at the same time. I was 20 while this all went down, by the way. Thanks to the incident on that day, I wasn't able to sleep. I remember having this absolutely horrendous feeling that something was wrong, but I didn't have the energy nor the courage to figure out what was going on, why I was hearing my family in whispered tones and muffled crying, etc.  I didn't find out about his passing until the next day after my shift at work. I really wish I would've had the courage and the strength to say goodbye to him. I'll never have that chance again, and it hurts. It really fucking hurts.  This is the biggest mistake I'll ever make, and the greatest regret I'll ever hold.",0,1719847624,,,0,lb50mx8,t3_1dssgca,t3_1dssgca,1719847641,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i
backcountrydrifter,,,"The reason this is breaking down now is because Russia, whose government was overtaken by the mob decades ago used the same network to interfere with elections around the world that it used for laundering stolen money. 

Facebook was used to encourage Brexit to cut UK support away from Europe because over a decade Ukraines push towards European integration threatened to expose a money laundering operation that Putin has spent almost half a century building. Cambridge analytica/ Nigel Farage and Steve Bannon critically dovetail into that as well.

Epstein specifically targeted Prince Andrew because he was the weak link in the royal chain. That‚Äôs KGB Kompromat methodology that was repeated with trump since the days of ray Cohn (his mentor) and the early Russian trump hotel, miss universe pageants, the pee tapes, etc all the way through Lindsay Grahams repressed homosexuality, trips to moscow etc. 

Facebook was also used primarily by Prigozihns Internet Research Agency (I.R.A).  They went so far as to send young newly recruited Russian internet trolls on expenses paid tours around the U.S. so they could more effectively imitate mommy bloggers and 2nd amendment enthusiasts online to sway the 2016 election to the US candidate they had the most control over-  Trump.

The cozy bear/fancy bear hacks and manipulation of the 2016 DNC primaries were necessary to keep Bernie Sanders out of the finals simply because Russia and Israel have no Kompromat/control over him.

when 40 years of Russian mob money laundering gets outed at the endpoints- (trump and Netanyahu‚Äôs respective corruption trials) things start to break down quickly. 

The Russian mob/government planned on stealing the U.S. economy in an American version of perestroika.  I‚Äôm not sure it was a grand sinister plan as much as the result of systemic governmental corruption and ridiculous Silicon Valley valuations overlaid on commercial real estate speculation, but the results are the same. Too big to fail does not apply at this level of corruption.  The cancer simply overtakes the host and western democracy, then humanity dies. This closed loop eco-system of cancerous corruption is just a larger scale model of the gulags that preceded it. 

It just required altering the new online reality to keep people oblivious until it was done. It‚Äôs effectively the KGB‚Äôs soviet era surveillance state, Kompromat, intimidation and mind control from Putin‚Äôs formidable years in the KGB cross bred with the video game grand theft auto in the digital age. 



Ukraines ‚ÄúJewish Nazis‚Äù as Putin likes to call them standing up to a bully destroyed the kleptocrats cover because they broke the code. 

When the Putin loyal oligarch Kolomoisky was arrested in Ukraine for corruption it cracked the trump-Putin money laundering channel.

To quote the late John McCain- ‚ÄúRussian is a gas station run by the mob‚Äù. Sometimes the work is for their own mob monopoly, and sometimes they do shady work for hire. 

The CCP needed 2 things to be able to replace the USD with a programmable reserve currency of their own and destroy freedom of press and western democracy forever.  

Grain and  Microprocessors 

Putin promised Xi Ukraine in 3 days during the first week of the Olympics so that Xi would have the grain and supply chain lock (neon) to take Taiwan and TSMC without putting 400M of the poorest Chinese into famine.  

Now, 2 years into a 3 day war Russia desperately needed shahed drones and gave Iran the intel it then gave to Hamas for the Oct 7 attacks. 

The governments of Russia, China and Iran need their kleptocracy to stay dark  for their corrupt business models to survive. 

Trump, Netanyahu and MBS do as well.  The reason it‚Äôs all strange bedfellows is because sorting by nationality is their traditional tool to keep all of us fighting so they can hide their grift from the masses. 

Ignore nationality and religion.  Sort by psychopathy and net worth.  The results are exponentially more accurate.

Ukraine and Gaza are both genocides with a primary purpose of obfuscating mob corruption inside these government networks.  

The separation of church and state was a preemptive caution against what is happening right now.  Kleptocracy cares about neither and will use both with abandon to further its insatiable singular goal.

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

I don't see harm in complementing standard medicine with alternative methodologies. After all, many modern medicines are based on natural discoveries. I suppose in some cases, there may be counteracting effects to consider when mixing medicine.

Our journey with this has just begun, I'm consuming information like a madman and trying to stay optimistic and open to any and all possibilities.

My mom was around but my sister was still a baby and took up most of her outside-of-work time. I started feeling worthless at 14-15 when I started feeling ""stood up"" by my dad. It started with small stuff like him promising to help me with a computer project and then forgetting/getting home late. I asked if we were going to the father-daughter dance but he couldn't get time off. He promised Id have my own room but could never find the time or money to finish drywalling the spare room. Stuff that seems like its not a huge deal but it hurt. I started picking fights with him just so he'd engage with me. Let my grades slip so that he would have to ask me what was wrong, etc. The more I acted like a moody teen, the more he ignored me so I tried engaging with his interests which still somehow sparked arguments. I wish I could tell you that his life settled down and he started to make time for his family - that now, as adults, we understand each other and are good friends but that's not what happened. He was diagnosed with late stage cancer when I was 17, he didn't live to see me turn 18. I wish I could have explained to him how hard it was for me to be yanked from a life where I was comfortable and safe and transplanted into one where I was alone with no validation or support - how often I compared myself to other teenage girls whose families seemed so close and supportive - how many times I convinced myself that if I were better looking or smarter or more charming or more talented then life would be easier and he would be proud of me and find time for me. Instead he always just seemed mildly irritated that I wasn't able to keep it together. If I tried to tell him how I was feeling he seemed angry - demanding I tell him how I could think that way or who made me feel that way. He wanted to know: was I being bullied? Did I think I had it worse than other kids? Did I know how lucky I was to have all the opportunities I had? I never had the words or the emotional strength to tell him that his emotional neglect was crippling me. I guess what I'm trying to say is I remember vividly what it was like to be a 15yo girl feeling worthless and ugly and unlovable. I don't have any way of knowing what the root of the issue is for your daughter but whatever it is - spending time with her, validating her as a person, and being an affectionate and present father will definitely help.

[Here's a 2 minute test](https://www.anxietycentre.com/tests/anxiety-disorder-test) you can take. It let's you know roughly where you rank in severity (if it comes back relatively low, it might be social anxiety, for example).

[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with anxiety](/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image. [More about box breathing.](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-fear-and-anxiety), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly expose yourself to situations that you know gives you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print, you can replace spider with anything, fear of driving, fear of using a phone, anything.

* [How to Overcome the Fear of Spiders](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-the-Fear-of-Spiders) (wikihow)

Overthinking:

* [Intrusive Thoughts and Overthinking: The Skill of Cognitive Defusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3vhXQy48jo) (youtube, 1.2M views)

For the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarms, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: /r/Meditation
* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

Be sure to give yourself time to get into the JW (plan for at least 30 minutes to get into and through security for big panels) since there is one line to enter the hotel building and then you'll be guided to the escalators that take you to the second floor where the diamond and platinum rooms are. Then you will go through a security (metal detector) and badge scan kiosk so once you're inside you'll see the bathrooms on your right and signage directing you to where the rooms are.

Last year I wanted to see the Yamada-kun premiere in the Platinum room and the security people let us into the panel ahead since there was empty space still in the room for the previous panel so they just told us to go in. You might see the security people outside the ballrooms do the same thing just to keep the areas cleared and gives you a chance to sit in a chair and relax. I'm personally going on day 1 to the JW Marriot for one of the premiers at 10AM just to avoid the chaos of the main convention. I did this for the Bungo Stray Dogs panel last year on day 1 at 10AM and they let us into the room an hour before it started to sit inside which was great and there were people whose friends were still waiting outside in the main hall line well after our panel ended.",0,1719848626,,,0,lb53no1,t3_1dshyah,t1_lb4w0ec,1719848642,1,False,animeexpo,t5_30jab

People are doing the same with responsive desire, this is a shitty desire type to have, life would be hell if people have responsive desire at all other areas, and people are not only feeling ok with having it, they say its the better type and make others feel bad by having the right desire. 

But, well at least with responsive desire, there is an explanation, the responsive default by definition make them think that way. So maybe I am being too harsh with them, but there are some spontaneous desire people that say they should be ok with their desire, so some of what I said could be aimed at them.

Anyway, I wouldnt have a seriously relationship with someone with responsive desire, this thing is too crazy and nonsensical, this would remove 85% of the choices, but well, what I can do.

I heard using testosterone can change someone spontaneous desire to responsive (one woman said at an interview she started to see how it is to ""be like a man"", another doctor had a patient that started to do spontaneous desire stuff), so maybe they can use it (if they have money to do it).

If anything, the fact that GR went along show that her nature was pretty mild - the very opposite of conduct disorder (the actual clinical term for temperaments that could lead to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood). Those of us who fought back and reacted badly to our mistreatment were deemed difficult and our abuse has been legitimized. This is why you don't diagnose a child with ""psychopathy"" (an outdated term that means you are born this way) until they're 18, it's because you have no idea if a kid in infancy who has conduct disorder will grow up to be dysfunctional outside of their family system or if they are simply reacting to the abusive environment they're in. 

And the delusion of you guys thinking there is such things as ""pro GR"" boards just shows how completely disconnected you are at this point.

When I woke up from surgery, the nurses kept asking me if had trouble urinating, to which I replied, ""no"" but it kept getting asked. So the neurosurgeon that did the back surgery shows up and discussed what she saw, follow up care, and that she found a mass in my lower abdomen.  It ended up being cancer.  About 3 hours later, I was told I had covid as well. 10 months later, 9 rounds of kemo, a very long surgery at mayo clinic 13 lymphnodes removed, a tumor remove, and one mega dose of kemo for a week and Im cancer free.

Lupe Ortiz called it *una peque√±a magia* afterward, when the effects of Aric's healing had left her hair darker, and her skin smoother and fuller, and her friends inquiring if she had had work done. A small magic indeed, that Aric had started but Guadalupe Ortiz herself had completed.

""I can remind her body what it means to be healthy,"" Aric had said to Rita beforehand, ""what her body does after that is up to her, and not entirely predictable.""

""Whatever her body does afterward, it won't be as bad as cancer, will it?"" Rita had asked.

Rita had never told he mother about Aric, not everything at least. The two had met many times, and it had not taken long for Lupe to fall victim to that beautiful face that was attached to an equally beautiful body. It was after either his second or third visit that Lupe demanded to be given at least an hour's notice of any future visit so that she could *make herself presentable*.

""Mam√°, es mi novio, no el tuyo. No tienes que arreglarte para sus visitas,"" Rita had said. {Mama, he's my boyfriend not yours. You don't have to get all dolled up every time he visits.}

""Si fuera mi yerno no me arreglar√≠a,"" Lupe Ortiz had replied. {If he were my son-in-law I wouldn't have to get all dolled up.}

It was probably the first, but certainly not the last time that her mother had hinted that Rita and Aric should get married.

Rita's heart had been pounding in her chest, her hands gripping each other so tightly that all her knuckles were white, while she was asking Aric for help. And as her eyes went to her mother where she lay on the bed that had been her home for the better part of a week, one of a long series of weeks of pain and labored breathing, she could feel the calmness begin to settle over her, and her heart rate slow, and her hands relax as her connection to Aric came alive, and his voice echoed in her mind.

*No. So far, everyone who I have helped has done well.*

*Please help her,* Rita had said simply in that way they spoke to each other that required no uttered words.

In the end, it was Rita's mother who decided. Aric was adamant that it be her choice.

*Madre, puedo ayudarte si me dejas*, he had said to her as he connected to both mother and daughter. {Mother, I can help you if you let me.}

*No tengas miedo, mam√°*, Rita added as her mother's eyes grew large at the shock of hearing both their voices in her mind, *deja que √©l te ayude*. {don't be afraid, Mama. Let him help you.}

Her mother had slept afterward. Rita could not remember exactly when she noticed that evening that her mother's breathing had grown quiet; so quiet that Rita went quickly to her bedside, afraid to find her like Detective Rita Ortiz had found so many women: cold, and forever stilled. When she thought back to that day, Rita could almost convince herself that she had already begun to notice the change in her mother, as the years fell away from her and she regained some of the youth and health that life steals from everyone.

""√âl es un √°ngel que Dios nos ha enviado,"" Lupe had said to her daughter exactly a week later as she looked at herself in the full-length mirror, when the effects had taken firm hold, and could no longer be hidden by sunglasses or a large hat. {He's an angel sent to us from God.}

""No es un √°ngel, mam√°, es solo un hombre. √âl mismo te lo dir√° si le preguntas."" {He's not an angel, Mama, he's just a man. He'll tell you that himself if you ask him.}

Also there are some morally grey areas that could be explored. I recently watched an anime on Netflix with the title something about whales. In the anime some people got powers but had shorter lifespans. It was later revealed a creature on the boat was absorbing their life force in exchange for a power called thyme-ya. No one got to choose who got powers or not, and it was shown in the show how hard it was for others to watch their loved ones die early. Often times power has a price is a theme we often see repeated.

Eris_Grun,,,"I became a funeral director after losing someone who I loved. It was my first real loss. My stepfather, Dad, was in Iraq after 9/11 and exposed to burn pits and died of full body cancer. It happened so fast. It was found in May and he died a few months later in August.

Do you want to know what is really helpful for people like myself and you?

Sharing stories. You sharing this helps people who may be anticipating or maybe even just experienced a similar loss know that how they feel is normal.

Grief is so complex, and I remember feeling so strange, and often still do as a director. I don't see it as selfish or making it about yourself at all. I cry at funerals for people I don't even know all the time. My heart breaks all the time for people. So, what I see reading your story is empathy and sympathy.

This is a family you were close to. You have compassion. You watched them hurt, and you are hurting. That's 100% okay and valid.

Perhaps when the dust settles and you have the strength sit and have brunch or coffee and explain to them how you feel. How it hurt to see them that way. I think what I see the most from my end is that people are afraid of saying the wrong thing when in reality people need to hear it.


A conversation that encircles but in more detail:
It hurt too see you hurt that much. My heart is absolutely broken with you. I am so sorry.

A lot of people who experience loss will have moments of feeling like they aren't really being seen. It can be really cathartic to share that feeling of loss with them. I promise they won't find you selfish. If anything probably honored that he meant so much and that they mean so much.

People also like to speak about what happened fairly often. So, perhaps your honesty will make them feel safe enough to share, which will in turn give you clarity. Talking about grief is very healing.

And yeah, you‚Äôre right, a lot of degrees are going to be able to be replaced with AI. Kinda proves the fact that productivity going up, wages being stagnant, and job availability is going down. Probably why the concept of a UBI has become more seriously considered in the past few years. 

As I responded to the other comment with too, tradespeople put their bodies through incredible stress too. For example, I worked with my father in Florida after Hurricane Ian. I can prove two of my points right now. 1st, after the hurricane, do you know how many people started working as wet drywall removers and demolition contractors? Take a wild guess as to how good the money was after the market was saturated. It was barely worth it to offer it as a service from our company, but we had to because it kept the company doing business, even if it was for low value. Same thing would happen if every college grad decided out of high school that welding is neat. All of a sudden, welders would make a lot less money if everyone knew how to weld. 2nd, do you think all of the self employed contractors in Florida were following OSHA guidelines during those removals and demo jobs? Do you think they were all wearing respirators when removing enough black mold to make even the french upset? No, they weren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre making good money today as contractors, but when they get a severe fungal respiratory infection tomorrow or develop cancers from exposure to the shit in construction materials and whatever grows on them after being flooded, that treatment is expensive and their quality of life suffers.

So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren‚Äôt regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher‚Äôs fault?

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had acting coaches tell me I‚Äôd never book a co Star then I did‚Äù

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

‚ÄúCoaches don‚Äôt want people to be successful because they won‚Äôt study anymore‚Äù

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You‚Äôre not even thinking your arguments through now.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique‚Äù

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it‚Äôs something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it‚Äôs on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

‚Äî-

It feels like you‚Äôre treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don‚Äôt see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it‚Äôs always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I‚Äôm at the point where, generally, I don‚Äôt learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

Based on Brad‚Äôs tweets, he‚Äôs not super familiar about the I/P conflict and the absolute cancerous discourse around it since October 7th. A few years ago, people reserved the term ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù to refer to religious extremists in Israel that wanted to continue building settlements in the West Bank, but extreme pro-Palestine advocates have extended the definition to include anyone that thinks Israel has a right to exist. Nowadays, if you‚Äôre labeled as a Zionist, the connotation is that you support Palestinians being completely wiped from the West Bank and Gaza, when in reality you may just think Israel has a right to exist. Believing that Israel has a right to exist is a perfectly normal position to have - in fact, a vast majority of American Jews think it should. It has gotten to the point that the word ‚ÄúZionist‚Äù has become a derogatory term for Jews.

Ethan and Hila are very pro-Palestine and the only ‚Äúcrime‚Äù they‚Äôve committed is that they are Israeli citizens and because they believe Israel should exist and that October 7th was an atrocity - again, belief a vast majority of Jews share. I see the attacks on H3 accusing them of being extreme ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù as a complete mischaracterization of their beliefs and as blatant antisemitism. Many (if not all) the claims made toward Ethan and Hila are either a gross mischaracterization or are downright false. Lots of bad faith actors have pushed this narrative because said actors will accept nothing less than the dissolution of Israel.",0,1719852345,,,0,lb5ezho,t3_1dsfyjk,t3_1dsfyjk,1719852362,2,False,BradTasteInMusic,t5_3az5hs

It is extremely uncomfortable for everyone. I mentioned this in another comment but we love rules, and know the rules we made a decision to let him run the game and to let the game happen because playing was more important and our availability is limited.

So I was trying to be vague but our child has Rhabdomyosarcoma (bladder cancer). 

It's important because what little time we have we chose to spend with them playing DND, our family decided to treat us like shit for reasons we don't know. It's important because even with all that we showed up prepared, happy, smiling, inclusive, and trying to not make our problems ruin anyone else's game night. 

  
We have other kids to take care of and finding child care to go play a game on a consistent schedule is almost impossible for us. The time we have free we spend with him and our other kids, so yea, we'd love to find another group but finding a new play group is hard, it's really hard for us. 

Do you think we haven't been depressed during this? We aren't ignorant or being insensitive but only an asshole makes it everyone else's burden. Only a selfish person makes everything about them. 

They haven't called any of us for months to check on us see if we're doing okay, they haven't been here for us when we've asked them for anything.   
Every time we see them she has to say something is making her sad, something bad happened to her. Yea people can be sad, and talk about being sad and I honestly didn't realize what she was doing for a long time.  So the comment she made about ""no one at work said anything to me about my work anniversary"" looking at me pouting, but her eye's were just empty and it was so stupid, so self obsessed. So her first decision is to try and make us feel bad for her, like every time, this time what she said was so stupid it felt like i was looking at a pyscho and not my sister. It gave me clarity that she doesn't feel empathy anymore.

SpiderCop_NYPD_ARKND,,,"Keyword ""perceived"", as it does none of the above as a part of its modern fiction or intention.

I work in Health Insurance with the ACA, so I'll go over all 3 of those: 

(1) The current ACA doesn't overreach government authority at all. Everything the current ACA does,  it does with existing Government Authority, the two exceptions,  the initial requirement that States expand their Medicaid programs to cover anyone with income at or below the Federal Poverty Level,  was struck down before the law ever took effect in 2014, and the requirement for individuals to have Health Insurance coverage or face a fee on their taxes was reduced to zero in 2018 (though this actually did more harm than good,  see 1A).

(1A) The requirement for private individuals to have coverage or face a fine was actually a cost saving measure. By having a many people covered as possible, they increased the pool of premiums paid in, which is the pool used to pay out claims. By removing that requirement and shrinking that pool, Insurance providers (companies) have had to raise premiums to keep up with the increased numbers and costs of claims from expanded access. All insurance uses this pool & pay system, good drivers car insurance is used to pay the claims of accident prone drivers. People who live in places with good weathers home insurance premiums are used to pay claims of people who live in tornado alley or in coastal areas with hurricanes. Healthy peoples health insurance premiums were already used to pay for sick people's claims. All removing the requirement for was shrink the pool and make it more expensive for everyone. Which has just exacerbated the cost increases to be addressed in point 2.

(2) Cost is something difficult to understand,  so I'm going to get into how costs have increased as a result of the ACA to help people understand that it really isn't the ACAs fault. To start,  it must be understood that *access* to Healthcare is different than *having* Healthcare. Access to Healthcare is having insurance and doctors/hospitals/pharmacy services (providers) that take that insurance that you could choose to use. Healthcare is the services those providers, well, provide. The ACA is there to provide access,  not Healthcare.  It helps people get and afford insurance. It does not,  however, educate or hire new doctors, specialists or, pharmacists, build new hospitals or doctors offices,  or otherwise increase the number of providers available. So, basic supply and demand applies,  if you increase the number of people with access (demand) but don't increase the number of providers (supply), what happens is basic economics,  the suppliers raise prices. These people are in are also more expensive to treat,  which I'll cover in 2A. *However*, things don't stop there.  With increased demand,  supply always tries to expand to meet it. But with specialized services like Healthcare,  that takes time.  If fast food demand goes up,  you can train a thousand new fry cooks in a week if the labor pool is there, but it takes upwards of a decade to become a general practice doctor, longer to become a specialist. Supply hasn't had enough time to answer the increase in demand yet. Further, people having access to and using Healthcare will in the long run reduce costs,  because someone who can go get that funny feeling checked out and catches their cancer at stage 1 is cheaper and easier to treat than that same person without access who let's it faster into they end up in the ER and discover it at stage 4, but that also takes decades to happen. How do we know all this? Because we've seen it happen in dozens of nations that instituted single payer systems in the latter half of the 20th century.  The same patterns played out every time,  an initial huge spike in costs, followed by a gradual decline as demand expanded and general public beauty improved. We're just happen to still be in the spike.

(2A) There's also the fact that the ACA eliminated the ability of Insurance Companies to discriminate against the people most in need of coverage,  people with preexisting conditions. If you had something like arthritis,  and you had a gap in coverage (for whatever reason) longer than a certain period,  *if* you got renewed coverage (they could also simply refuse your business entirely) insurance used to be able to just tell you you were out of luck regarding coverage of your arthritis because it was preexisting with a period where it was unmanaged. Sucked for you,  but it saved the insatiable company money (and thus,  saved those they would cover money since they weren't paying premiums to cover those claims). The ACA made it so that they have to cover you and can't charge you more for having preexisting conditions.

(3) I've actually already covered the effect on private insurance really, those who previously already had coverage are now competing with ACA coverage recipients for a limited supply of provider services, so they're seeking the price increases as well as having harder times getting appointments.

But all of it,  all of this,  is secondary effects and side effects of *trying to fix what was fundamentally a broken system*, a system designed to  cover healthy people and fuck over everyone who actually needed Healthcare. Working in this field, the people who I hear complain about it,  are the ones who were benefiting from that system as it was before,  healthy or well off people who had insurance before the changes and didn't get shafted by it at the time who are bitching about the fact that the system is working to cover people it wouldn't before and that's making things (momentarily, as I've explained above) more expensive.",0,1719853101,,,0,lb5hc8p,t3_1dswbj3,t1_lb54utl,1719853119,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i

goldenphotog,,,"Oh man, I hate that. I can‚Äôt say much for the recurring dreams part because this was a one-time thing if I remember. I‚Äôm going to paste a response I made to someone else because I think it would apply to you, and I‚Äôll also add that nipples can shrivel up at even very slight stimulation so unless it looked so weird to the point where your breast looks dented or something I wouldn‚Äôt worry much about the shriveling. Here‚Äôs what I had said previously to someone:

I‚Äôm so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I‚Äôve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery‚Äî they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn‚Äôt see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She‚Äôs not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it‚Äôs something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it‚Äôs really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day. You don‚Äôt mess around with this shit, and if your doctor seems to not be taking you seriously, find a new one.

rkb1990,,,"Just a few thoughts for you on this: first and foremost, it's tough, and it sucks, and sometimes there's no easy way to figure any of this out. There can be an expectation when we make it through cancer that all of a sudden we've got this clarity about how life works, or we should have clarity, or if we still muddle our way through like everyone else then somehow we've lost an ""opportunity"" given to us by cancer. That's just not true.

FWIW, I (55M) was about your age when I was diagnosed with AML in 1990 and felt or experienced much of what you've described. None of us are equipped to deal with a cancer diagnosis at 20-ish, not our friends, not our families, not us. You're still close enough to it that it's okay to rage. You should be angry, and sad, and emotionally drained because there's a lot to process.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll get through this. Time helps. Patience and kindness with yourself helps, too. With or without cancer, I still wouldn't have figured my shit out by the time I turned 30, or even come close to understanding the lasting impact it would have on my life. It will always be part of my story but I don't have to let it define or consume me.

Your mileage may vary, but therapy helped me out a ton.

My mom's (62yo) breast cancer is back. I'm an only child (34F) and live in a big city with my husband and 8yo daughter. My mom's been married 6 different times, and the last time she had cancer she was married in a different state and her then husband cared for her. I did also go there to visit and help, even though I had a baby.

Last year, she left the city where I live, sold her apt and moved to a small town 3h away, where her best friend lives. She bought a great house with a yard and four dogs, it's her dream life and I'm happy for her. However, she is an older woman with a chronic illness, and decided to live alone in a random town. She says she can't stand living in a big city anymore and I understand. However, I think she did not think this through.

Since we found out the cancer was back, me and my husband decided I had to go there for her surgery and all. This is really disruptive for us, cause we don't have a lotof help. It's just us and our close friends looking out for eachother and the kids. I WFH, so it's simple enough to work from my mom's place.

I was there for five days and the surgery had gone really well, we were back to her house, I was cooking and cleaning and taking care of the dogs. However, it's difficult because I don't get along with my mom, she left to France when I was 16 to marry a French man, and left me with my abusive father. She eventually came back, but I moved away, and we haven't lived together for almost 20 years. She doesn't say things clearly and criticizes me constantly, even though she won't admit she does this. Also, she considers our relationship to be close and good, and in her opinion she never ""left"" me.

So, I sat her down to ask her what the plan was. Since she had chosen to move away by herself, what was she thinking in terms of healthcare, how could we help support her, anyway, it's her life and she's a grown woman and I cant choose for her. This really upset her. She said I was ""demanding"" things she couldn¬¥t possibly know, and that she doesn't ""think about being sick"", it's touch and go. I told her that if she doesn't plan for times like these, we have to, and that's not fair. So, she was very offended and said she thinks it's ""natural"" for someone with ""empathy"" to be there for loved ones. She refused to make plans or think things through, and finally said I don't have to be there if it's such an effort.

So, I left. I cried a lot, I said I wish her the best. But I can't stay there indeffinitely, and especially not like this. I need to be able to talk, and I need to be treated like her daughter, and not her tutor. I came home to care for my daughter who was really upset I wasn't here.

I'm heartbroken and this is difficult for me, but I think finally ""divorcing"" my mom will be a great thing, actually. She may see me as a selfish person, but that's ok. I can't be a good daughter to her, and she's not really a good mom to me either. AITA?

It got me really pissed that he hadnt studied in the last 10 days and thats how the fight started because he didnt want me to mom him and tell him what to do. 
Some more context here : his dad was abusive and cheated on his mom when he was 6-7 yrs old and abandoned their family. Hes the oldest son and his mom is a working woman whos gonna retire in the next 2 years. He completed cfa level 1 in 2019 but left it because he got into kickboxing and wanted to pursue that as a career. Did kickboxing for 3 something years, played professionally and also won matches at the national level but realised that he wouldnt be able to earn much there. Meanwhile I got hospitalised with a rare blood disorder called TPP whete I almost lost my life. He saw how expensive these treatments are sort of got a reality check. He was with me throughout my treatment and to help me get over it. He got back into CFA and got the course for some 60K 3 months back. Since 3 months he hasnt really studied much and I believe its not my place to force him to study because thats his call. And I dont care how much he earns, I care about the fact whether hes working towards making our future secure. Its infuriating how laid back he is. But I also understand that this is a major shift for him from cfa to kick-boxing and now cfa again. I was feeling anxious about our future and I burst on him saying that I dont see hum getting serious about his career. The only mistake I made was maybe the way I saif it wasn‚Äôt nice. I could have had a conversation with him instead of attacking him like that. But nonetheless I didnt apologise for it. Because in my opinion I did the right thing. 

For some more context about myself: I have completed my MBA this year, got placed in a company in Blr but have been working from home because of my medical issues. Our plan was that I will be doing wfh for a year or so and in the meantime he would clear his cfa too. After clearing his level 2 we would shift to a city where we can live together because here I live with my dad and my younger brother. My dad keeps on nagging me about my salary and how I can do so much more in life. Hes a very hard to impress dad. I wanna move out asap for my own mental peace and to protect the relationship I have with my only parent (my mom died of cancer 10 years ago). I told him that I have decided to shift to blr whenever i can and that infuriated him so that because he thought I am abandoning him when he wanted me to stick by him for a year.

Defiant_Brother_1172,,,"I had to comment here, not because I can think of any great advice, but your mom‚Äôs diagnosis sounds like what mine had and I haven‚Äôt really come across many people with the same. It seems unusual to me that it spread to the bones but nowhere else. 

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT‚Äôs, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn‚Äôt want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon.

GoldfishChronicle,,,"This is related, but not the same. I hope it can help you anyways. I was the close friend/girlfriend (13 yrs) of a man with terminal colorectal cancer; my own father passed away in 2021 from prostate cancer. His son was in the final year of his degree when he was admitted to emergency surgery for removal of the blockage in his bowels, it was the first any one of us knew of his condition. We only knew he had been unwell but the doctors thought it might be colitis and they were still testing when things rapidly fell apart. 

Truth be told in the hospital, his son was in shock, so young to be confronted with such a situation. He was concerned with how he would balance his job, relationship and school. He looked like he wanted to run away, back to normalcy; I didn't blame him. But I admit to feeling a little frustrated, because of my own experience I know the guilt that arises after, despite the fact that I was with my own father every step of the way... I was worried he would regret his actions and words at that time. But I am not him, and he is not me, so held my tongue. He ended up completing his final year and graduating. His father passed away just weeks before graduation. He made it to say goodbye.

While my loved one was sick, he would save his energy to mask his pain and worries in front of his son. After recovering from the first surgery, I told him, he should reserve his time for his son, he needed to rely on his son, his son needed to feel needed, to know that he helped in a meaningful way, or else he might pay the price later on. Not quit school, but to be confided in, or asked to help every so often. Not fully sheltered. I don't know if he took the information to heart. 

What I do know is this: You could have been in the same room as your mother, day in and day out and still feel guilty. The brain looks for the cause, it wants to know how to avoid the pain again, it wants the source. It will play tricks on you, having you rethink things over and over again. A child is meant to diverge from the path of their parent at some point, lead their own life, separate, but together in spirit. They didn't want to break your path, ""even if I cannot go forward, they can"". This was her wish, she didn't want you to suffer then, even though she can't save you from it now. That was her choice, you can be angry if you don't like it, because valuable information was withheld from you. That is fair. 

Your path was meant to move away from them at some point, the death feels very different when your path was tied to walking with the departed as a life partner; be gentle with your father. You lost the same person, but you are grieving different relationships. You can tell him you don't want to be kept in the dark ever again, and tell him how it has affected you when you are both ready. Anger is normal, it will pass. You will want to fight something, anyone, anything, when you are not reconciled to what has happened. (I am guilty of this too.)

Your mother set out to protect you for as long as possible... She did her job. You did what she wanted you to do. Over time forgive yourself, and just know she loved you very much. She was probably content with you out of the storm and yet worried for you all at once. Be angry, be sad, feel guilty, feel numb, but do not despair. Do not lose hope or the courage to move forward later, when you slowly regain your strength. She did not want you to stagnate, do not forsake her wish. Be an example for your father, he will be lonely, let him know you still have each other. Let him know you still want him to witness your accomplishments and want him there to tell you he is proud. Let him know there is still life after loss, even if it doesn't feel that there will be ever again. It probably feels really unfair that he is almost making you be the strong one. Let the adult part of you listen carefully to your inner child who is rampaging and inconsolable right now. Don't admonish them, they've just suffered a catastrophic loss, their whole world is changed, be soft with them, let them have a few free passes, one day, the tears will be less and less frequent. Life will be different, but the sun will come out again.

Be kind to yourself, this hurt takes time to scar over. Don't rush, be patient. You will heal. (I'm so sorry this is so long, I am grieving too and I tend to ramble when I am sad and introspective.)",0,1719829348,,,0,lb3usm9,t3_1dsogs2,t3_1dsogs2,1719829365,4,False,grief,t5_2s369

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

Shadowkiller00,,,"I manage my basic hygiene just fine, but my dentist hates that I don't floss. Every time I go to the dentist, my gums bleed. It has been true my whole life. It was true when I was a kid and didn't brush and it's true now when I brush daily. It was true when I flossed haphazardly and it was true when I flossed religiously. 

I flossed every day, sometimes twice a day, for an entire year and I showed up to the dentist proud of how well I did and you know what he said? He said, ""oh, it looks like you've finally started to floss."" I was crushed. I put my absolute full effort into flossing and it barely counted. An entire year and he treated me like I had only been floating for a week. 

Here's the thing, my gums don't bleed when I floss. Why? Because I know how not to injure myself. This means I don't build up those gum callouses that they want me to have. Finally, after I got cancer, I realized there were more important things to worry about than making my dentist happy. 

So what does my story have anything to do with your question? Because I've had plenty of heavy friends for whom the struggle not to smell is real. They sweat constantly. They crank the AC, they have fans running all the time, and they don't wear underwear because it just makes them sweatier and, in turn, stinker.

I can imagine how hard it must be sometimes to work your ass off every day trying to keep yourself smelling nice only to fail. Worst of all, most people can't smell their own stink, they only get told by others and that makes them feel like shit.

There are some who just lack the routine, it is true. There are actually entire cultures that try to mask the stink with cologne, every single person I've ever met who does this is from the middle east or south Asia where I hear it gets rather hotter than here. You are lucky to live in an age where AC is common and stinkiness isn't. 

But not everyone is blessed enough to have a body that allows them to make it 8-12 hours without gaining some sort of stink, enough time or facilities to take multiple showers a day, or the resilience of mind to keep them trying every day despite putting up with the constant verbal assault on their odor.

I can empathise with so much of what you are feeling, you are still very much in the early stages of this grief and as the commenter above talked about our minds do play tricks on us. There is the constant thoughts trying to rationalise what happened and we always look to blame ourselves, even though we shouldn‚Äôt. I read something a while back about how our brains basically have to re wire to adjust to the loss.

My mum was older (68) than yours, but still too young, when she passed from cancer just over a year ago, and I have struggled with those same regrets. I‚Äôm not sure they will ever go away completely but I am trying to rewire my brain I guess. I moved away from my mum to another state a long way from her for 17 years before she died, and I feel so much regret over being away from her for that long. I would usually see her once a year and talk on the phone a lot. I feel like I missed out on so much time with her. Whenever I have those regrets or guilt about that I force myself to remember how happy she was that I found my husband here, and was happy. I know your mum probably felt the same, she would have been so happy to see her child following their dreams. All they want for us is to be happy. 

I also lost my dad to cancer 18 years ago when I was 24 and he 54, for years I felt a lot of guilt about not really being present when he was sick, I think I tried to escape the reality and pretend everything was normal, it is much easier now and I try to just think of the good moments that I did have with him. 

Having lost both parents to cancer now i understand just how traumatic those images and guilt can be, but want you to know that those memories and thoughts will lessen. They won‚Äôt go away completely, but you will find room for the better memories.

Garokson,,,"My Standard recommendation list:

* **Death after Death**: This is a very good darker gamelit isekai subversion that actually has some great character developement. In here a pro-gamer let's himself be reincarnated in a roguelike dungeon reality by truck-kun. But what when it actually turns out that your gamer knowledge isn't worth much? Watch how the MC comes slowly to this realization while trying to escape the hellhole he explicitly wished for. In true roguelike fashion of course. Namely Death. By Death. By Death. By Death. By Death.
* **Godclads**: In a world where the 1% wear the remains of lobotomized gods as a mantle of power, where baseline humans are just cattle to feed the soulforges, where intimacy is retributed by an eldritch plague, where technology is powered by mind-breaking necromancy, it takes a special someone to upend the status quo. But who would have thought that a cannibalistic ghoul actually had the decency to do something against it?
* **Chosen One Protective Services:** What do you think would happen when Wizards weren't the kind gandalfian mentors that chose and protect you but instead con artists that chose you to get new young fodder for their brutal dungeons? Poor Rusty will show you the full abject terror of it. But what happens to the ones left behind? Watch his heavily burnt brother Cyrus claw himself through ordeals just to get his sweet baby brother back and find out.
* **On Foreign Soils We Die**: Ever wondered what would happen when a world war 2 country ruled by Dragonborn get's declared war by another country that uses isekai murderhobos against them? When system favored people that murder draconic gods for sport, facetank artilleryshells and call upon the wrath of the sun god invade? Well, tune in and find out.
* **Source & Soul: A Deckbuilding LitRPG:** There are really only a select few turn based card battler - real card battler - stories in the LitRPG genre and this is the first one that actually makes it work. The two MC's, a sidelined third son of a noble family and a abused street urchin down on his luck, are both well and immersively written so that you just want to keep reading. Even the character growth is real. I also really like that they aren't genius players right from the get go and actually can lose or misplay their matches. There aren't even bullshit lootbox mechanics that only are there to shove random super powerful and undeserved cards into the MC's pockets. So their power really feels at some point quite deserved. The system itself is sufficiently complex to allow theorycrafting but not overwhelming. The battles are, thanks to the mechanics, quite fast paced and are over in one or two chapters. And yes I also wouldn't have thought to ever say this ... fast paced card battles. So all in all I can only recommend this.
* **Tenebroum**: Finally a good Necromancer story that is as evil as they come and more importantly without being edgy. Watch this story about a resentful wraith trying to get vengeance for his brutal murder. If he just could remember it. So why not go for corrupting the living and subjugating the world instead?
* **Toad Town**: What would you get when you combined a mentally damaged system, a fat dungeon fairy, a mutated goose as well as an inbred toad without any kind of ethics that got reincarnated as a buggy dungeon settlement core? Gutwrenching fun. That's what you get.
* **The Cabin Is Always Hungry**: Forget carousel, this seems to be the new and upcoming great horror litrpg with the ritually sacrified main character - who became a dungeon core - actively having to realistically re-enact slasher horror movies to level and survive.
* **Elydes:** A very nice slow burn LitRPG with a good progession-ish skillsystem. It starts out with a cancer patient being reincarnated on a beautiful island nation where he know get's the chance to live a full life. Well if there wasn't imperialism and tragedy threatening him and his family. Watch how this young MC actually works and claws himself through the system and world while actually earning his steelclad will.
* **Vae Victis**: Marianne, a vampire trained by the south american mafia, got basically isekai'ed into a high leveled jungle and is now on a survival spree. Add a unique class system that is based on masks and fusing them with their subclasses called 'ornaments' and I was completely hooked. It's written by the author of IR so it's prose is quite good.
* **Vainqueur the Dragon:** A satire about litrpgs and isekais where a dumb and greedy Red Dragon forces a thief to help him to become an adventurer for the looot while making short work out of each an every rpg and isekai trope you can think off.
* **Threadbare 1-3 / Small Medium 1-3 / Blasphemy Online 1-3 / Threadbare 4-6:** All of these play in Generica and are interwined. It has a very good system were you can level by combining jobs. E.g. You can be a Knight and a Necromancer which are tier 1 jobs. If you're then buffing your undead from horseback with knight skills you unlock the tier 2 Death Knight job and so on. The stories themselves are very humorous and well written. The first is about a sentinent teddy bear golem that has to save his little girl and does this by accidentally becoming a necromancer. The second is about a Small Medium at Large - so she is basically a hobbit with grifter and luck manipulation skills that has to save the village that's getting attacked. The third is about a player becoming a dragon but due to some mysterious circumstances the npc controls his body in the RL while the MC is ingame. In Threadbare 4 all these threads are then combined which promises an even better story.
* **Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends:** This one has one of the best skill trees to date. You basically have three pillars. Classes that give you abilities, cultivation that gives you techniques and skills like |Evade| or |Darkvision| that are based on your understanding of them. You can now mix and match these three pillars to create truly diverse and unique builds. E.g. there has been an enemy that could summon stone axes and armors with his cultivation to fight with, while his class gave him the power to reap the experience from his enemies. Another one is a dexterous dual wielder that got ethereal powers from his class, reflex and combat buffs from his cultivation and supports this with skills like Evasion and Fighting Styles. So he basically became a uber mobile dodge tanky striker with teleportation powers. The story is also great. It's basically about gods being bored and thus decided to create a few unvierses for their entertainment. At a certain point in time the universe get's crashed by the Framework and they're told that only the 10.000 strongest will be teleported to the next world where they have to compete against each other until the big finale starts. 
* **Apocalypse Tamer:** A satirical, quite funny and at times grimm mixture of a system apocalypse, a dude that just wants to live with his pet pokemon and annoying monsters that just don't let him live in peace.
* **Deadman:** A LitRPG in the style of a full fledged Fallout game experienced out of the eyes of a ghoul.
* **The Hedge Wizard**: More of a gamelit but this story of a wandering mage reads *exactly* like a good DnD game which each book being it's own full campaign from start to finish.
* **Demon Card Enforcer:** Do you want a darker and action packed neo noir card battler with copious amounts of good boy demon doggos, mobsters, leveling deckbuilding, half dead protagonists and bullets to the head? Oh god so many bullet to the head of people. Then this might be something for you.",0,1719832574,,,0,lb401fu,t3_1dsp468,t1_lb3w7up,1719832591,12,False,ProgressionFantasy,t5_x7vh9

I (F26) am on a 14-day birthday trip with my friend (F30) for her 30th birthday in Europe. We have traveled to multiple countries, with our last country being Sweden because she said it was cheaper for her to fly home from Sweden than our actual last destination (Spain). I am the only friend of hers that decided to come on this trip. 

While in Spain, I got a call from my family back in the US that my grandma wants to stop her cancer treatment and will probably pass before the end of July. I am distraught, but I wanted to finish this trip out fully since I couldn‚Äôt change my flight home to be earlier (only 3 more days), and for my friend. 

My friend has frequently done things on our vacation that have made me feel crappy and made it difficult to travel with her, such as telling me within our first 2 days that she finds many of the things I do annoying. 

She went out last night with a friend who was in the area, and I stayed in because my family had just rushed my grandma to the hospital for the 2nd time the past few days. She came back after midnight, and told me that she was going to move her flight to Sweden to land at 7pm, instead of the flight we booked together to leave at 10am to land at noon so that she could sleep in.  

We are only in Sweden for 2 days, and her landing at 7 basically puts the first day as a wash. I‚Äôm fine with solo-traveling, but with the news, this isn‚Äôt a time I wanted to be alone. I told her that I was shocked that she would move her flight not only without asking me about it, leaving me to take our original flight alone, but with the news I just got about my grandma, it would never cross my mind to leave a friend alone during this time just to sleep in, especially if they flew all the way to Europe for my birthday trip. 

I brought it up to her, and she doubled down and got upset at me for not wanted her to prioritize her wellbeing and for expecting her, in her eyes, to ask me for permission to change her flight. 

AITA?

2. PLAYFUL/DIFFUSING: say you're waiting for someone to give you a really good reason. Bonus points if they say something lame like, ""god loves you"" or,  ""it's a beautiful day,"" and you just look more defeated and say, ""well that's not very helpful/interesting""
3. EMBARRASSING: Immediately make eye contact and whine, ""I'm so sorry I'm trying so hard I promise-"" and then unload emotionally taxing drama on them like your pet has cancer, your landlord died in a terrible accident and you can't take your mind off of it, your parents are fighting, your car is acting up and you desperately need more money to fix it. Just unload every personal problem you have. Guarantee they'll never pull that nonsense again and you basically get free therapy.
4. EMBARRASSING and DISMISSIVE: ""Ew!"" And a small jerk away. This is absolutely the most appropriate reaction because anyone oblivious enough to pull this is provably pretty oblivious to everything about themselves.m and their demeanor.

People think it's harmless, but it's such a rude, socially stunted, and inconsiderate remark that creates undue pressure. It doesn't spread positivity; it calls attention to negativity without offering anything substantial or empathetic. You're making a demand of someone in a potentially tough momemt for them without any consideration for their wellbeing.

Good lord. Have one iota of situational awareness, I'm begging you.

If you think this behavior is appropriate, please find better alternatives in:

1. If you know the person and it's out of character, authentically ask someone if they're okay. Create space and be accepting if they're not comfortable talking to you.
2. If you know this person and they're busy, very focused on something, or know they're probe to game-face; leaving them alone or making a supportive remark like ""thanks for being so diligent about this task"" or whatever that's actually relevant and positive.
3. If you don't know them and they're idle, giving a passive and non-threatening compliment or supportive remark. ""Hey, thanks for being part of the parade. You guys are going to kill it out there!"" Don't touch them or compliment a physical trait.
4. If you don't know them and they're busy or clearly focused, leaving them alone. You wouldn't ask a surgeon to smile in the middle of a procedure, would you?

faithlessfish,,,"I might be able to have some insight into this. 29, Born and raised in Huntersville, still live in the area, went to the school that initiated the research into the cancer cluster. 

My parents were transplants to NC. I grew up with what could be called an idyllic childhood. My schooling was fine, I felt like I learned a lot, got a good education, had plenty of friends. the area around where we lived was safe, I was always able to go out on my own, ride my bike wherever I wanted to, walk around with my friends, etc. 

My family was solidly lower middle class I think. I don't think My parents would have been able to afford that kind of life for me if we lived in comparable areas close to Charlotte. Areas close to Charlotte that they could afford to live in would not be of the same quality as growing up in Huntersville.  

They both worked in dilworth area, South charlottish, so they would make those commutes to Charlotte and back to Huntersville everyday, In the days well before 485, the toll roads, etc. Those commutes were worth it for them to offer the best quality of life they could with what they could afford.

JasonBourne81,,,"Depends on families I guess. 

My father was very open about the finances. In fact, my siblings and I (we are 3 siblings)were taught how to manage finances when we turned 15. 

All 3 of us had to manage the budget for 2 months of summer vacation which included savings , investments and emergencies. We all did it when we got our turn. 

Once we turned 15, all big financial decisions were planned, discussed and finalised in dining table with both my father and mother listening to our opinions.

When we turned 21 we all got ‚Çπ10 lakhs to build a future for ourselves. We could have spent it on anything. Building a business, studies, wedding or whatever. 

My eldest sister went on to do MBA from Stern School of business. 

My 2nd sister went on to do double Masters in Archeology and Architectural Conservation and subsequently followed it up with PhD. She is one of the foremost conservation specialist in historical architecture. 

By the time, I turned 21, we didn‚Äôt have much money left as my mother was diagnosed with cancer and everything went towards her treatment. Anyhow, whatever I got from my father over the years plus healthy dose of scholarships, I did my master in economics and MBA.

ambientonion,,,"Well done OP. Stick to the shrooms. This is where I wanna get back to. I'm an hour off being 6 days clean at the moment. Best abstinence since February for me, where I went two weeks because I went away. Back in 2022 I was tripping on mushrooms and DMT once or twice a month, having a beautiful time, feeling more in touch with myself and the world, and discovering new music. Then my dad suddenly got diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer and died, and that's when I turned first to benzos, which I have binged and abused historically, and then to codeine, because codeine provided me with the same numbing and anxiety relief, but without getting me so far gone I don't know what's happening. 

The sad thing is I bought some co-codamol for legitimate shoulder pain in April 2023, having had opioid issues before but thinking I was far past it, saw no harm in having a few. Of course I CWE'd the rest of the box, and ""just once or twice"", turned into five times, and ten, and so on. Soon I was ordering DHC strips off the darkweb.

SoccerGamerGuy7,,,"Agreed. Even a 3rd trimester abortion isnt out if choice; it is medical necessity. The mother is actively dying or will be dying soon; the baby has no chance of life post birth. These arent examples of abortion it's miscarriages. Medical care just eases the burden on the body of the loss but it is still a loss.

As for ""post birth abortions"" is an insane take. The only plausible fact he could have been referring to in the most twisted and ridiculous lying ways would be in the case a baby survived birth but would die within minutes or hours due to severe birth defects not compatible with life.

In that case the most ethical medical option is palliative care. Same as we would do for an old grandma dying of cancer; make them comfortable, and reduce pain and ease suffering for their inevitable passing. 

these arent ""abortion cases"" these are some of the most traumatizing and sad medical situations wanting parents go through.

MonsterMike42,Default,Satanist,"I've thought about my grandfather, who passed away in 2010, and I've realized how good it is that he passed away when he did. He was a lifelong Republican and did have some prejudices. He wasn't an out-and-out racist, but I'm sure he said a few things that would be considered racist now, and he was homophobic because he was raised to think it was a sin, but never really made a big deal about it. I didn't find out about it until after he passed. He was also a genuinely wonderful human being most of the time who would help others, even those who were different. It didn't matter. Jesus would help people so so would he. To the point that when he was dying of cancer, while in a great deal of pain and worn and tired from the battle, he drove over to our house to give mom's car a jump to get it working again. He easily could have said no, and we would have definitely understood, but he helped us anyway. Cause that's who he was. That's the part of him that I try to model my own behavior after. 

I feel confident that, if he were alive now, he would be a Trump supporting MAGA type. His quiet racism and homophobia would now be loud. I know, because I've watched his wife, my formerly super-sweet grandmother, become a worse version of herself. Previously, the most racist thing I had ever heard her say was when she was talking about going to a wedding party where the bride was black, and therefore, so was her family. Grandma said that when she walked into room and she saw all the black people, her first thought was that she hoped they wouldn't play rap music because she doesn't like rap. That was the worst thing that I'd heard her say about someone of a different race. Recently though, my sister had the ""pleasure"" of spending most of the day with her, and lil sis told me afterwards that grandma went on some tirade about Mexicans living in an apartment building. She doesn't live in an apartment. She lives in a house in a subdivision. She literally just complained about Mexicans (that did a job for her, btw) having a place to live. She also spent a bunch of time complaining about how nobody wants to spend time with her. (Which is probably because she's constantly complaining about whatever flaws we have, real or imagined. I may have posted in a previous comment very early this year about my last interaction with her. Spoiler alert: it was very bad.)

Yeah, I fully believe that, if he were still alive, grandpa would be the type to support Project 2025 and Donald Trump becoming president again. So, to unleash my inner Jeanette McCurdy, I'm glad he's dead. Because it means that I can remember him by the good memories I have of him, and I won't have to mourn him twice like I will with grandma.",0,1719835351,,,0,lb45bra,t3_1ds5utr,t1_lb0hfcc,1719835369,1,False,exchristian,t5_2r95q
herbal_thought,,,"Watching the man or woman you love and adore suffering and dying can do some serious damage to our minds. It affects us in so many ways for the rest of our lives. More so if we are codependent on them for our happiness in life. 

But we need to try and find a way to make the pain less, to become less miserable, otherwise what is left of our life will be a wasted mess of frustrations, loneliness and depression.  

But I can recognize that raising two kids alone means you have no time or energy left over for you, or to find a way to heal or to deal with all that you are struggling with. I am in deep awe of you and your strength to continue like this for seven years and continue taking care of your kids. I have been struggling with my wife's death from her breast cancer for five years and I am without children. So I am sure you don't feel like it right now but you are in some ways incredible. But you need to find something, anything that you can do that can help you escape and repair even for short moments. 

The first few years I had used guided meditation initially to fix my insomnia but also just to find a way to reduce my misery. It sounds silly but the goal of meditation is to teach you how to focus on your breathing and in turn not notice our negative thoughts and the nervous chatter of the mind. Our mind will never shut up and will always talk crap about ourselves, so the less you hear all that crap, the easier it might be for you to heal. I had used the Headspace app mostly because I was too exhausted to go our after work and I didn't really want to be around other people. And the cost of the subscription for a year was cheaper than a therapy session. 

They also offer therapy-like session that deal with stuff like grief, lonyness, and sadness wrapped around a meditation training. Below is a sample of the grief sessions. There are thirty 15 minute sessions which you can do once or twice a day after the kids are in bed. If you think you can get some brief moments of escape or peace, try completing their grief, sadness and anxiety sessions. You might not feel better at first, in fact the grief sessions might make you feel worse, but if you keep it up, over time you might find your pain and suffering a little bit less.

Note if you can afford to or can get access to a social worker or a therapist for free please do it. It can also help in small ways. 

Another thing you can do on your own is think about who were you before you met your husband.

I could barely peel myself out of bed to sit in my home office chair. I atrophied from being sedentary for months. All of my muscles weakened while my tendons and ligaments got overstretched. We thought it might be EDS (it‚Äôs not). 

After a surgery on the heart, my right arm and shoulder were so painful that it‚Äôd wake me up multiple times a night in agony.

I never thought 46 was that age. This is in addition to watching my face fall one side at a time while my brain function tanked - I legit thought I‚Äôd had a stroke or was getting dementia. The depression and anxiety dialed to 11. I could no longer function at work - I would cry and be emotional in front of colleagues and then curl up into a fetal position under my desk and weep between meetings (fortunately work from home). I had to quit and was told that I‚Äôd made a commitment to complete a mission and was letting the team down. I was wrecked. 

I‚Äôm now six months from surgery and two months unemployed - the surgery was excruciating, recovery has been torturous, the pain meds jacked my gastrointestinal tract so I ended up hospitalized with diverticulitis (while in an immobilization brace for my arm).

This was all in 6 months. Now what to do to start over at 60? No spouse, children, close family or friends as my mom was my best friend. Just me in this quiet house. A glass of wine (or margarita) and sit on the deck but now what? Time to decide what's next. It still feels empty right now which will get better with time I guess. Just floating right now. Wish I had some words of wisdom to share. I just wanted to say I so relate to what you are feeling.
I'm trying to stay positive & looking for those things that have meaning & truly make me happy now. Looking for a chapter while healing from the previous one. A new path that will lead to happiness. I hope you find a way to navigate this maze called life & start a new happy chapter as well. I just wanted to reach out & say boy do I know how you feel. Hope your future is bright.

Painfree123,,,"It's only natural that gout sufferers focus on preventing, or at least relieving, the pain of gout flares, and our doctors oblige. But after 15 years of gout pain, followed by 20 years of study, it has become clear to me that the pain of gout is an unignorable warning of something seriously amiss in our bodies, something which often has much graver consequences than joint pain. Just preventing the pain is equivalent to disabling the alarm of gout pain.

The cause of most gout is the frequent prolonged episodes of lack of breathing with lack of oxygen during sleep, known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is grossly underdiagnosed and is why most gout flares start during sleep. The episodes of reduced oxygen cause every cell in the body to abruptly produce excess uric acid, as well as slow its removal by reduced kidney function, leading to the precipitation of the urate crystals which cause gout when they form in a joint of someone who is genetically predisposed to gout. If OSA continues for too long, it will lead to many life-threatening diseases (eg. cardiovascular diseases, stroke, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer) and premature death, which has also been found to occur in gout patients, whether or not their flares are well controlled by diet and medications like allopurinol. Resolving OSA early enough will greatly reduce your risk for developing these diseases, and will prevent further overnight gout flares. See a sleep physician and get tested for OSA, and follow strictly the recommended procedure to resolve it. Gout is your early warning alarm!

I agree with your mom about not starting allopurinol at your young age. If medication is your only treatment, allopurinol will be lifelong for full benefit, although your lifespan will probably be shortened by gout's life-threatening comorbidities. But she is not right about dietary changes making much difference. What matters most with gout is not how we eat, but how we sleep.",0,1719836812,,,0,lb48bfq,t3_1douokb,t3_1douokb,1719836827,1,False,gout,t5_2syer

This post's original body text:  

Hello. To the people who have been on this situation and to people who are on the opposite side. I need your input.

A family member has cancer and is currently undergoing chemo. Due to the severity, we had no choice but to avail the services of a private hospital. As expected, the cost of treatment for each session is expensive. We found that there are agencies that could give financial aid, some of which needs for the recipient to be treated in a public hospital.

During the initial checkup from the oncologist, we have already stated that we ARE going to transfer to a cheaper hospital(public). But time and again the doctor has made ways to delay, such as witholding information, for us to plan our relocation,. We called public hospitals and asked the requirements so that we could find a new oncologist. One requirement is we need to have a transfer letter from our current oncologist.

Before the latest treatment, we had an appointment with the oncologist and stated that we need the transfer letter. They did not agree and we weren't able to get the transfer letter. He made excuses like we can still avail financial aid and use it on the private hospital. Our family is not rich, and we are only able to afford it because of financial help from generous relatives and friends.

I need help on the following:
1. How to be able to get the transfer letter or persuade the doctor?
2. I would like to understand why the oncologist doesn't want us to relocate.
3. Is the doctor allowed to deny our request to transfer?

RaspberryUnited9501,,,"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,,,0,lb4a5q7,t3_1dslxx8,t1_lb3onwa,1719837681,2,False,cancer,t5_2qixx

roymondous,vegan,vegan,">The individual does matter. 

>Whatever benefits the majority of individuals is the best decision. 

Right. So the individual doesn't matter. In and of themselves. In utilitarian philosophy. You can harm the individual if there's benefit to others. In the actual example I gave you, the individual didn't matter. You mixed them up. You shooting a deer does not stop an additional deer being predated as you initially said. 

>Population control heavily benefits the herd, and every animal given a good death benefits in that way.

""A good death"". Again, wonder if they'd think that. Or if they'd prefer to live, be with their babies, and be with their herd for longer. You are describing this in such weird ways. 

>Dominant males of herds (for deer in this scenario) rarely chase after predators unless they're cornered or too tired to run any more. Even if they did try to protect the herd, they're at a huge risk of injury or death themselves, so there's no difference. The protection is in the numbers of the herd, not an individual trying to protect it.

More assumptions. You clearly haven't researched the topic, as shown by your ignorance of just how much hunting contributed, among other issues. I don't care about your opinion. It does not matter in this discussion. 

>Option 1: 99% of wild animals die horrible deaths, but maybe some live a little bit longer.

Again, random numbers pulled out your ass. Please do a bit of research before making claims about who you can kill. You are assuming you have the moral right to decide who lives and dies - against the will of that animal (yes, comparisons to humans are valid). You require VER Ygood arguments to morally justify yourself in saying 'I have the moral right to kill you for your own benefit even if you don't want it'. 

>Option 2: Animals killed by hunters get to die a good death but die a little bit sooner. The others continue to die horrible deaths that they were¬†*already guaranteed*. Maybe they die a bit sooner too, it really doesn't make much of a difference.

A ""good death"" is a bunch of bullshit. Again, 

>We euthanize animals all the time, our pets. We make the best compassionate decision with the options we have. It just so happens that the most compassionate and realistic option for wild animals is a bullet instead of a medication.

Here is the current situation in Albania:

1. A scandal broke out at the cancer department of the country's main hospital, where surgeons and nurses were administering reduced cures to cancer patients and sold the remainder at pharmacies, which would charge crazy prices for the same cures. They also ignored treatment unless they were bribed by the patients' relatives.

2. The justice system of the country had 30-40% (can be checked online) of its judges and prosecutors fired over corruption. The decisions have been dubious. The current ones still at work are way too overloaded and can't manage the influx of cases.
Meanwhile, the lists of newly appointed judges and prosecutors are updated with tens of new names despite those not winning the magistrate exam.

3. In the education system, the principal and a few teachers of one of the main high schools (sometimes considered in the top 3) was charged with fraud because she PROMISED STUDENTS she'd get them to top US universities. The US Embassy had to make the case public to get the authorities moving.

What does this mean for an average Albanian (or TL:DR):

1. Your grandfather or sick relative may die in the hospital from maltreatment if you don't bribe his doctor.

2. If you end up in court there's a good chance your case will be ignored, or ruled by an incompetent or corrupt (or both) judge. In short, whethere you're right or wrong, you have to buy your freedom just in case.

3. Your kids, even if they are in a top school, may be defrauded by their politically appointed principal. Not to mention th universities which basically perform zero research, only teaching.

These are public stories, but there are millions of silent stories nobody publicizes. Now you can imagine why half a million Albanians left their country in one decade. It's an unliveable place.

In Albania the solution is impossible without politics. You need a strong, organized political group, with no ties to the establishment, to win elections despite vote buying and fraud, to uproot every single sector from the top, especially health, education and justice. It needs to survive from the strong opposition and criminal pressure, including the international drug traffickers that are becoming too hard to manage even for Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, let alone Albania.

unBnnBle1,,,"I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at 16 years old, the same year both my parents were killed in a car accident. I spent the next six years living with my reclusive Hungarian grandfather who worked in the death camps cleaning the showers. He was a drunk and would tell me haunting stories about his time there.

During this period of my life, I would make friends with people in the cancer ward only to see them die. Over and over.

Around this time, living in NYC, I was sitting in an ambulette in Manhattan when two planes struck the world trade centers. Bodies fell all around me exploding on the pavement and drenching the vehicle with blood and brains.

I can still hear their screams.

My grandfather shot himself after the attack and I discovered him moments before his death. I remember him holding my hands and looking at me with a terrifying intensity. He said that death was everywhere and inescapable and he was sure he'd be in hell soon.

My very next doctors appointment they realized that due to a clerical error, I had been misdiagnosed and was in perfect health, minus the harm the radiation had wrought on my body.

Given a new lease on life, I sought solace in drugs and spiritually. I attended a retreat in the redwood forests where I did heroic doses of LSD and DMT. Communing with entities unstuck from time and the corporeal body, I learned the secrets of the universe and spoke with death. I saw my grandfather burning in hell and bodies flying upwards off the pavement and back into flaming towers. I saw my cancer and all disease, I saw the masquerade of life as if truly is.

And in that moment, I willed into myself the elimination of fear and acceptance of my mortality. The entities told me the truth about life and death. That while we are immortal beings, our souls carry the scars of our time on Earth through all eternity and only through acts of virtue can they be mended.

Since then, I have dedicated myself to enlightening others.

To that end, I sell books on Amazon teaching people the secrets of living a heroic life, free from fear and pain.

Some facts.  over 90% of people that go to marriage counseling end up in divorce.  So keep that in mind.

The vast vast majority of separations end up in divorce.  Again keep that in mind.

 ""Is giving up something that's ""decent"" worth the risk or possible reward?""

Okay, here is what I and MANY other people here when you ask this question.

""If I get cancer, can it come out better because I will loose some weight?"" ""I mean I might feel bad, or I might not, so should I get cancer as I really need to loose a few pounds?""

I am gong to tell you some things you probably don't want to hear.  You have major faults.  You need to work on yourself a LOT.  Freaking work on your marriage.  Talk and work with your husband and have honest conversations.  I could put down what makes a happy and  successful marriage if you want.   My guess is you are missing the first foundation though.  

So lets just list some things you said about your husband.

1.  He has a steady job.  He could be better but again he has been a SOLID provider for your entire marriage.  You took a vow ""for richer and poorer"" he could even be out of work and this should not be a reason to leave him.  I get the impression if God forbid he was let go, you would have already have left him.  

2.  He is a good father.  Not an okay father but a good father.  Your children are significantly better with a mom and a dad and he has taken time to not only work, but obviously be involved in their lives.   A lot of women and children would kill for that. 

3.  He helps around the house.   Again tons of women would kill for this!   

4.  He hasn't cheated on you.  

5.  ""We have had many talks about this and he says he's trying to change but I don't want him to fake being happy going out and doing things if he would rather be happy being a homebody""  I am so angry just reading this.  Your freaking husband is trying BUT that isn't good enough for you!  What exactly are you doing for him again?  How are you changing for him? 

Now for another stat.  Over 50% of couples that divorce greatly regret it later in life.  Not one person but the couple.  Work on your marriage.  Keep working on it.

susevda,,,"I fasted through all my chemo treatments (8 rounds - 3 years ago). I still do 3-5 day fasts every couple of months for maintenance. Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days. It sounds scary but this is completely doable assuming your overall health is good and you have the OK from your doctor. After Day 1, the appetite shuts itself down, and you do not experience hunger.

The following excerpt is from a review published in Nature in 2018. The article explains the detailed mechanisms of how fasting works. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-018-0061-0. This is a high-level article though. There are more recent studies as well.

""Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) lead to wide alterations in growth factors and in metabolite levels, generating environments that can reduce the capability of cancer cells to adapt and survive and thus improving the effects of cancer therapies. In addition, fasting or FMDs increase resistance to chemotherapy in normal but not cancer cells and promote regeneration in normal tissues, which could help prevent detrimental and potentially life-threatening side effects of treatments"".

When she died he could still cook for himself but he went to stay at my Aunt's house a few miles away, mostly because he didn't like being alone.

Plantayne,,,"Something similar happened to my family.

My dad's aunt was really sick and slowly dying of cancer. My dad was the only one who cared for her. He went by there multiple times a week to check on her and help her, take her to her appointments, make sure she took her medicine, etc.

Meanwhile, his brother was constantly getting into trouble that my father had to bail him out of, his sister was in an abusive marriage that she refused to recognize as such, the entire family was a mess.

And all of this while my dad was working like 3 jobs too.

So finally my great aunt dies and she leaves everything to my dad.

His brother and sister are furious, even though he gives them both a share of the inheritance anyway. They accuse him of brainwashing her against them and doctoring the will.

They barely speak for the next 5 years.

His brother eventually pops up out of the woodwork, says he's gotten clean and gotten his life together, invites us all to his wedding. So we go and have a great time. My dad thinks at least that part of the rift has been healed.

A year or two later, he gets this horrible poison-pen letter from his brother, blaming my dad for every misstep and detail of his screwed up life.

And then he continues to get one just about every year for the next decade or so.

Eventually his brother dies and he's inconsolable at the fact that he was never able to fix their relationship.

Then in 2019 my dad died and for the final insult, when we called his sister to tell her, she said, ""Oh. Alright, well thanks for letting me know."" and she hung up on us.

DueCalendar5022,,,"I have gone through lots of stages dealing with my issues.  There was a time I felt really tired and slept a lot.  I was really stressed, alone, and scared of dying. I had to get up and go to work.  That helped.  It was a time I needed to be hypervigilant and focus on caring for myself emotionally and physically. I didn't have a TV or radio and internet didn't exist.  It was my first stage.  Healing happens gradually.  How do you heal cancer? Listen to your body.

I started managing my time as a teenage because I believe that what you do everyday will have a bigger impact on your life than self-evaluation, worry, or a lifetime goal.  I was a high school dropout, single mother, who  went to the library and wanted to become a systems engineer.  I didn't try to do that but it is eventually what I became.  I needed to heal.  Your body knows how to do that if you treat it right. 

I didn't know a soul.  I took an art class.  I talked to woman who told me to put my child in foster care and go to school (I didn't do that).  Instead I went down to the unemployment agency with my baby and cried every single time the mill laid me off.  They put me in a program that allowed me to go to school and paid minimum wage for the hours I attended.  

I read Helter Skelter and nailed the windows shut in the house I was living in.  After that I was very careful about the mental environment I was creating for myself and my child.  Healthy, healthy, healthy!  I had a go to routine for the days I felt sick and a plan for days I felt better.  I saw a woman walking one early morning.  She had obviously been beaten but she was still getting up and getting out.  I knew that path is easy to go down if you rely on others. 

 I hope you don't have anything like these issues to deal with.  Life can be very hard.  There isn't a plan, but there is lots of room for healing if you allow it to happen.

I constantly think my 'friends' don't want me around due to times I've seen them either confess it to each other or outright tell me. I've never been close to my family, not by choice either. We were raised that way. My mother was extremely abusive to my brother and I. She once held me high in the air by my throat in front of the rest of my siblings as a lesson. My brother is disabled. Sometimes, she'd had enough of him. Lock both her and himself in a room together. The screams I'd hear from him being beaten haunt me to this day. She once made me eat dog shit. I try and blame it on the fact that she had ptsd from the war, just to cope with the fact that my mother hated us and never wanted children. My father committed $uicide when I was 4 years old. Since then, a couple of men tried to fill his place in my mother's eyes. Recently, my sisters confessed to me that not only have those men sexually assaulted them, but my mother knew about it and chose to do nothing. 
She kicked us out of the house this year because I didn't want to live under the same roof as a sexual predator. For context, I had just gotten home from work, sitting in our kitchen, and her husband pulled his d*ck out in the dark, jerking it off while looking at me through the doorway.

Instead of shining the light for her to get down, she told me to finish up and head down after her. She fell off the room and was taken to the hospital the next day after a night of pain. They found her cancer just in time, as she was set to die within a month if untreated. I didn't see it as a sign of god.

QHS_1111,,,"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn‚Äôt my  body warn me? why didn‚Äôt I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I‚Äôve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn‚Äôt love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I‚Äôm working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn‚Äôt make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I‚Äôve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn‚Äôt dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs for the best and I‚Äôm actually happier now that I‚Äôm not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I‚Äôve had so much change in 2.5 years I don‚Äôt even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I‚Äôm meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

muddyshoes_throwaway,,,"""using it EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT YOU CANT FUNCTION WITHOUT = ADDICT.""

I disagree. Consider this: weed is used medically to treat things like anxiety, depression, EDs, chronic pain, nausea, etc. Lots of people try various different medications before they find one that works for them, with side effects that they can live with. Most people, when they find a medication that works for them, continue taking it. They treat their medical issues with the medication that works.

If someone has really bad depression and they find an antidepressant that works well for them, why would you expect them to stop treating their depression with it? 

If a cancer patient finds a medicine that helps with chronic pain and nausea, and helps them maintain an appetite, why would you expect them to stop treating their symptoms with it? 

If someone finds a medication that works for them, they should be able to use their medications to treat their illnesses and symptoms without being judged for it.

Personally, I consume cannabis in some form, every single day. I treat my severe anxiety with it. I had been on a handful of other prescribed medications for it, and they either didn't work, or had horrible side effects. 

Would you rather I use Xanax everyday and develop a xanax addiction? Because I would rather use weed, which has minimal side effects, is less chemically and physically addictive, is easier to monitor intake, and can be tailored to what I need in the moment.  

Some people forget that weed is literally used to medically treat TONS of different illnesses and symptoms. I think it's ignorant to think less of people who finds a medication that works well for them, and judging them/thinking less of them for taking it.

I worked as a peer supporter (so am I qualified?) and the advice given in this thread is genuine and evidence based, along with a healthy dose of experience. This is what mothers are missing in our society, people who know and understand the mechanisms of breastfeeding to support and advise others.

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I‚Äôm making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I‚Äôve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I‚Äôm in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60‚Äôs. I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo‚Äôs, one 14yo). It‚Äôs all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it‚Äôs a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won‚Äôt really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we‚Äôd have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we‚Äôve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I‚Äôm very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don‚Äôt particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I‚Äôve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I‚Äôve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life‚Ä¶I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what‚Äôs the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They‚Äôll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they‚Äôd have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

Cadyserasaurus,,,"In my general experience, these women think they will be the exception to the rule. They identify more with being white than they do with being women. They‚Äôve been raised to believe that if they do everything they‚Äôre told: get married young, start popping out kids, etc. then they will be highly valued and therefore safe. 

They think that abortion and birth control laws are for promiscuous women; but as soon as the fetal test comes back with a fatal abnormality, they want that abortion and are shocked that it isn‚Äôt an option. They think women are more valuable & fulfilled as stay at home moms & tradwives; which is why they never see it coming when their husbands leave them at 40 for a woman 20 years younger. They think their husbands care for and value and love them; until they get breast cancer and find out their husbands would rather divorce them than give even an ounce of that caring back.

First, this documentary:

- Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani (2020)

An ideal, a pioneer, an Albert Einstein or Alan Turing of hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry in mathematics, with an unbelievably inspiring story. She serves as an inspiration to numerous female students all over the world, and many awards are presented in her honor. Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani, a young woman who was honored with the Fields Medal (even while battling cancer, she didn't give up), won 2 gold medals at the International Olympiad of Mathematics, achieving a full mark! Scientists often describe her work as wielding a magic wand. Sadly, she passed away a few years ago at a young age due to cancer.

May 12, the International Women in Mathematics Day, marks the birthday of the award-winning mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani.

This documentary tells the story of her life, the education system, politics, etc. It doesn't capture the whole culture, but it highlights one of the main parts, especially the lives of teenagers (interviewed with students).

Directed by George Paul Csicsery. Filmed in Canada, Iran, and the United States.

- Interstellar

We as a species weren't designed to be powered by Sugar, the most addictive substance in the world. Sure it will sustain you just as my ancestors lived/ survived on Potatoes. Extra Sugar turns straight to fat, but they were active and didn't have the calories available to get fat. 
Big Food is the biggest pusher of sugar, why do you think they put it in EVERYTHING? That's what dealers do, get people addicted to their products for Profit and silence the competition. 
Big food and pharma own the politicians and they will not tolerate anyone that challenges that monopoly. That's the reason they are going after the""Quacks"" that promote keto and carnivore diets, natural medicines and taking a holistic approach. They actively shadow ban anyone that won't comply as they are all in it together. 

Rockefeller started the American cancer society to do just that after his oil based ' medicine "" started giving people, you guessed it, CANCER. HE sponsored the medical community and flooded it with his henchmen to keep his profits flowing. Anyone that bucked the system was immediately labeled a quack and ostracized so voices were silenced. 


We are being played by the system, a system that pushes pills that treats but doesn't cure. They spend billions on advertising money that will be better spent on research. 

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

Not laughing at you, OP.
Laughing at how ACCURATE you are. 

Because.... I AM THE RESULTS of doctor NEGLECT! 

I was 16 years old when I got this disease and absolutely NO ONE even knew what it was. 
I was out on birth control because they had NO CLUE what to do. 

I did NOT get a formal PCOS diagnosis until I was THIRTY THREE (33) years old. 

I was having ALL of my reproductive organs removed BEFORE I turned 35.
Because of.... CANCER! 

PCOS doesn't cause pain? 

Sure! 
Shall we go through the checklist of MEDICAL CONDITIONS PCOS CAUSES! 

Sleep Apnea 
Acid reflux disease 
Lymphedema 
Diabetes 
Dental damage
Bone weakness
Cancer

What does sleep apnea do? 
Oh, it only CAUSES YOUR HEART TO SLOW DOWN! Which can cause PARTS OF YOUR HEART TO NOT WORK RIGHT! 

Acid reflux disease? That comes with a hiatal hernia and a SPLIT DIAPHRAGM! 

Lymphedema. Has ANYONE here experienced leg swelling so bad that the pores in your leg start RAINING LIKE A FAUCET down their leg. 
I have. It was EXTREMELY PAINFUL. 

Diabetes. This? Oh, this only leads to KIDNEY DEATH! 

Diabetes is the ONLY disease on this list I DON'T have. 
Why? 
I watched my father DIE FROM THIS! 
He became diabetic and after 30 years his KIDNEYS DIED! 
Resulting in the last 6 years of his life to be on KIDNEY DIALYSIS! 3 days a week. FOR LIFE! 
Until it CAUSED HIS HEART TO NOT FUNCTION RIGHT! And NEEDED a pacemaker and that STILL DID NOT WORK!
BLOOD POISONING!
Frequent trips to get the port for dialysis fixed because it kept clogging up.
It LITERALLY KILLS YOU!

PCOS DESTROYS Dentin. IE Teeth! 

Bone? PCOS weakens bone. 
To the point they are EASILY BROKEN! 

And one of my favorite topics. 
Cancer. 

NO one ""gets"" cancer because EVERYONE is born with cancer. 
Cancer is antigens that is literally part of the bodies DNA. 
Example.:
Uterine cancer is also known as marker CA 125.

Every type of cancer has a marker and they can mutate and become cancer at any given time. 

Been down this road and literally waiting for breast cancer to show up. 
Just so I can CHOP THEM OFF! 

I know all this because from 33 to 36 I had a REAL OBGYN and she taught me everything. 
Then my insurance changed and I could no longer see her. 

I have NOT had an OB since. But. I also have NO reproductive organs to concern myself with. 

I am the RESULT of YEARS of NEGLECT! 

This is what UNTREATED PCOS LEADS TO! 

A LIFE of medical disability and PAIN! 
Oh, and I am ONLY 46.

And ... Studies have PROVEN that PCOS leads to an EARLY DEATH! 
Meaning WE DIE sooner.

A few thoughts:
- I can agree with your form approach to honoring a commitment but on the other hand, there are valid reasons that people leave jobs/relationships/schools despite the intended commitment.  Depending on how much stress she is feeling, I think your husband's condition that she can do so if she finds something else as a substitute is actually a good approach.  

- it's early still.  What if you asked her to give it two full weeks and then reassess?  Sometimes it just takes time to adjust and she may actually lean into it all after a bit more of a time investment, and she may look at things differently once she sees what she can do with that paycheck.

- Can you encourage/facilitate more social interactions with friends during the evenings and weekends?  I'm guessing some of her peers are dealing with similar Issues and might even have more difficult work interactions -- I'd rather work at a camp, personally, than bag groceries or be a fry cook.

I am actually on the other side of this same fence.  my 16 year old daughter had originally signed up for a 4 week counselor in training program (unpaid )that would lead to a proper job next year.

I was like you and wanted to hold firm but her dad read her differently and felt she was really in need of a break after a very demanding school year (where we live 10th grade involves a high amount of standardized tests that carry weight in postsecondary applications).  I reluctantly agreed.  I hate the couch rot, the messy room and the lack of structure.  I don't love that she turned down a great opportunity that she probably would have enjoyed to a given extent at least.

raccoon-nb,,/·ê† - Àï-„ÉûÔΩ°Àö·∂ª ùóì ,"It's about the cat's health.

Cats don't understand the concept of gender, and therefore having no testicles does not really psychologically effect them. They aren't losing their manliness or anything. Generally, they're running around, acting as normal within half an hour to an hour of the procedure. They don't even know what happened.

Neutering is mostly done for the health benefits.

As the procedure involves the removal of reproductive organs, it eliminates health risks associated with those organs. A neutered male cat will never get testicular cancer. A spayed female cat will never get uterine or ovarian cancer. A spayed female cat will also never have to suffer pyometra (a painful, potentially fatal uterine infection common in older intact female cats).

Changes in hormone levels also decrease the risk of other issues. Neutered male cats are less likely to suffer prostate diseases. Spayed female cats are less likely to develop mammary tumours.

Female cats go into their first heat at an average of 6 months of age, sometimes as young as 4 months of age, and while at that age it could be very dangerous for them to get pregnant (comparable to a human child or teen pregnancy), cats have no knowledge of medical concepts like that, and they breed purely on instinct. Having male and female cats who aren't spayed/neutered may very well lead to pregnancy/birth complications as well as cat overpopulation and hoarding. Cats also have no sense of biological family and do not hesitate to breed with cats they are closely related to, so if intact cats of opposite sex who are related to each other are kept, inbreeding will become a huge problem.

Male unneutered cats do not go through heat cycles but are fertile year-round from the age of 4-8 months. They often go through intense sexual frustration and stress, leading to territorial behaviour. It's not good for their psychological health, and it can lead them to get into fights or wander too far and become ill or injured alone.

It has been found that neutered male cats live an average of 62% longer than unneutered/intact males, and spayed female cats live an average of 39% longer than unspayed/entire females.

It also has a very low rate of complication, and almost never has long-term effects.

For the above reasons, it is strongly recommended by welfare organisations and veterinarians alike to spay/neuter pet cats.

I saw a lot of interesting activities on the internet, but realistically, I couldn't afford them, especially in the Philippines. Those from wealthy families are fortunate; they can easily try and get into activities. But for someone like me from an ordinary family, I thought maybe if I worked hard, I could have those things. However, as I got older and progressed in my career, and could somewhat afford hobbies, I asked myself what the trade-off would be if I pursued an activity I was really interested in since my youth (racing)

I then realised that it wasn't important for me to pursue that endeavor. It would take away time from my family and friends. I wouldn't be able to help save my girlfriend's condo. I couldn't assist in treating my father for his cancer. And I wouldn't have time for more important things in life.

CeilingUnlimited,,,"I've had a very bittersweet experience with this subject. Looking back on it as a 58-year old with four kids and eight grandkids - I wish I would have waited longer to have kids. (Poor as church mice, we were pregnant with our first child just six months after marriage.) I have three younger siblings who waited. The fact that they are younger and the fact that they waited all combine to create a current situation in my family where my oldest daughter is 35 and her oldest cousin in 15. A twenty year gap between my kids and my siblings' kids. It's created an extended-family situation where my kids are very much different, and very much outside the norm of the rest of our large, otherwise-tightknit family. 

Example One: My stepmom recently had cancer and one of my sister-in-laws created a special family text-message thread ""just for the adults"" to discuss her cancer, omitting the grandkids which, by default, omitted my 35, 33, 32 and 29 year old daughters. 

Example Two: As my kids (and grandkids) all live out-of-state, I spend much more time with my nieces and nephews than I do with my kids and grandkids. This includes holidays, as my part of the family can't afford to get together very often, so I often spend Christmas and the like with my close-by siblings and their kids, my children and grandchildren nowhere to be seen. 

Further, my kids grew up very working class, with our family struggling to get ahead. My siblings' kids have all had a very-much opposite experience (the waiting contributed greatly to this) and I've had a catbird seat to compare and contrast, my own kids coming out on the overall losing end.

I love my family and wouldn't trade anything. But, I would re-do if I could... I'd wait a solid five+ years before having kids after marriage, especially as the oldest child of a tightknit family. Eternal families are supposed to have a tighter bond than run-of-the-mill families and ""go through eternity together.""

I am a published author, I mean I am no James Patterson, Stephen King etc and really it's not the purpose of me writing but I make fun money off my book sales. In a given month I am in the green by $100-300 dollars on a new book depending on the book genre and season when first published. I don't really even do it for the money, like I said. I have a fulltime job and do plenty of other gigs as a performer slash artist on the side because it makes me happy. Artistic expression just makes my world brighter and helps me from falling into bad mental health cycles as I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD, or what I like to call, the Holy Bullsh*ttery, blessed be it's name. 

I started writing as a kid because I am dyslexic - highly - like ever see a person when you spell a weirdly spelt word and they look like they want to jump into oncoming traffic? I'm worse. Don't give me verbal directions FFS text it. Point. Anything. The second my mental word is required to need to know too many words at any given time, I panic. I have tried every class, app, TikTok lifehack...its not my strength. I am good at other things like coding or planning events etc. I have other strengths. So I just do my best and keep swimming like a dyslexic Dory. 

THAT SAID I was teased and bullied relentlessly all through childhood a lot growing up and labeled the dunce so the trauma lives. 

For an example, I was in my local paper - small town - for an event at school. I was like 2nd grade at the oldest. I made a whole imaginary town out of recycled materials and and had a story with it as my end of year project. I worked on it for literal months, even figuring out how to make it foldable so it easier to travel with it in my grandfathers minivan. My story had 10 chapters and was handwritten in my messy kid handwriting. I had a teacher Ms. Smith. That's her real name because F that woman and it's common enough. She said my project was low class but ""I guess I shouldn't expect much from you"" and she walked off. Her son, my classmate, stomped my project to oblivion. He smashed my playdough figurines of the people and pets, and as if that was not enough, he pointed and laughed at me when I cried. He then put copies of the article with my picture but added a dunce had and laughing faces in the school - lunchroom, homeroom, etc. I mean the guy could cure cancer if he used that determination on it, I will give him that. If you're reading this Tyler - F you in particular and may your socks always be just a *little* damp. 

I was unlucky enough that when I moved, Tylers mom happen to as well, so guess who had the privilege of that gem's company for 3 grades? Tyler shoved me lockers in the 4th grade. He called me dumb every day. In 5th grade I was called dumb and fat (I was an underweight child). 

So fast forward and I am now in my early 30s, still dyslexic as hell. I live in a different state. I have a life and learned ways to deal with my weird brain and function. I moved on from childhood trauma, therapy, etc etc... 

There is a guy I liked, Brian, and Brian seemed to like me too so we decided to do ""non-date causal hangouts"" to see if we vibe enough to consider dating (his words and idea). We hung out one on one for several instances but once he was super late so I had my laptop out. He saw me when he arrived and asked what I was doing and I sheepishly responded I was working on my next book. He inquired more and I told him I published my first when I was 17 and have published at least 1 every year since then and told him of Ms. Smith and Tyler and more horror stories I won't get into as this is now a novel itself lol but that it spurred me to prove them wrong and beat this weird stereotype that neurodivergent folk are dumb, etc. He asked to read it, and I said no. I use a pen name on purpose as those Amazon reviews can make you want to yeet your own soul from your body so I keep it separate from everyday life. 

Well, turns out if you know me and my nerdy joys, my pen name is easy to guess. From there its easy to *find* because I mentioned Amazon and let's just say my bio makes it pretty clear. At our next meetup he asked me if I was said author and my shocked Pikachu face told him everything so he started reading the series. He came back the next time we met to laugh and say ""I see why you don't put your name on your works. Don't quit your day job. Your writing sucks."" and he placed a copy of one of my books down on the bar. 

I couldn't help but drop my shoulders. He was laughing and talking, not seeing my expression and kept saying how he wasted hours of his life and FFS someone take my laptop as it might be a lethal weapon meant to kill us all with boredom. 

Turns out he's not into mysteries or fantasy. I said that maybe it's just not his genre and he said it wasn't but ""an [R-word] 3rd grader could have done better"" and it's a good thing I am good at my job. It was then that I could see he actually took in my expression and he backtracked. ""I mean you clearly don't do it for money so it's whatever right? "" and said I have other strengths but he did not believe at all that I make money off this. He asserting surely, I buy my good reviews and probably bulk buy my own books to improve sales. I don't do any of that. 

I just smiled it away and said ""well, I can't please everyone but I did make 250 this month from the sales of my last book alone so some people must like it"" and laughed it off. But I knew then and there I didn't want to pursue him anymore. When he texted to see if I planned our next hang out, I was honest and texted back that I wasn't interested and said that while I can take a note or any criticism, the way he went about it was hurtful and I don't want to be with someone who treats me that way for a hobby, that we are different people but I would like to remain friends, as otherwise we get on well, but nothing more. 

He went off on me saying I picked the wrong time to lash out as he was having a bad day and now I've made it worse and that I am so rude and petty to be mad at honest criticism. He said that if I am so sensitive over honest opinions, good luck finding anyone who would want my dumbüçë since looks are all I have with makeup and work and ""nothing between the ears"" 

I blocked him but we have a mutual friend group and almost all of them have been asking me what's going on and that I broke his heart. I was thinking *what*? *How*? They said he's been depressed and asking about me and figured out I blocked him on everything and wants to give me a birthday gift (my birthday party past last week and I didn't invite him). My friends are saying we are adults and this is immature.¬† I mean I am not a saint and I have toxic traits too, but I don't want to be with someone who criticizes me and my work that way and treats me like bantha poodoo. Am I crazy? Am I TAH? 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/1OrGaLGdUj)¬† **May 5, 2024** 

Hi - so for anyone who cares to know, Brian told all our friends that I rubbed my achievements in his face and called him an idiot (I never said anything like that). He told them also about my post so he found it somehow and started telling everyone that I am trying to slander him as ""girls can ruin a man's reputation by snapping her fingers"" and suggested my next move would be to say he assaulted me. 

Some of our friends came at me hard saying I was bullying him and trying to ruin his rep and all he did was asking a girl he liked out for drinks and that I need to apologize and just suck it up and go to drinks with him. They since have either outright not invited me out with the group or disinvited me to events and it was really hard to accept. 

I was realy confused, because he was the one who made fun of me and I wrestled with myself going over every talk again and again wondering if I inadvertently said or did something to upset him. It wasn't until I checked our text and message history that it occurred to me to send the screenshots as he called me a moron and then when I rejected him he called me fat, desperate, and stupid. And there were more such messages after he found my book series. So I took screenshots and sent it to my friends and they were shocked. 

Apparently according to Brian my outwardly ""sweet demeanor"" hides my judgemental and cruel side and that I strung him along anf called him a loser when I told him I wasn't interested in dating him. I even pettily went back before all of this and screenshot spme of his rude or mean texts he made. And I screenshot my actual rejection text and his response and sent that along as well. 

Now the tides have shifted and most of our friends think he was the AH and 2 of our friends are saying I am sending ""my choice"" of screenshots to make him out to be a villain and that they have seen the ""real"" screenshots of me bullying him. I asked them to produce such screenshots but they refused and said I wouldn't be worried about them if I was innocent as some sort of ""gotcha"". 

I feel really bad as I wanted to stay friendly but I can never look at him with any semblance of respect anymore. I am glad it's cleared up with my friends (sans the 2 holdouts but they are now also on the outs with the group) so things are looking back to normal. I have my first publishing party for my next book and everyone is invited but them. 

Weird way it all ended but oh well.

So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father‚Äôs situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister‚Äôs college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn‚Äôt have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn‚Äôt happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn‚Äôt respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop ‚Äúholding her tuition over her head‚Äù. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever ‚Äúpay me back‚Äù nor have I ever ‚Äúheld it over her head‚Äù. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn‚Äôt realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she‚Äôs still young. She once again didn‚Äôt reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It‚Äôs a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn‚Äôt replying to my texts and I‚Äôm just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn‚Äôt from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

karenfromfinance16,,,"I think some would argue about how peaceful it really is, if some sponsors are also complicit with an ongoing genocide. I don't get the sense that the original intent of pride bothers the protestors, but the increasing corporate presence does bother many in the community, for a variety of reasons. The ties to genocide is understandably a more urgent concern. I guess one way to think about it would be if the annual breast cancer runs/awareness campaigns were being promoted by people who were also funding anti-lgbt campaigns. Queer people would understandably have an issue with those groups using public breast cancer events to gain positive press while at the same time harming them. 

All that to say - if you actually want to avoid a shit show, the best way is to engage in good faith that this isn't about pride itself, but the parts of pride affiliated with a genocide. I know many protestors who have personal connections to Palestine - ie friends, colleagues, and family who are there, who they've seen live (or not) through truly horrific circumstances for nearly a year, with no end in sight, in spite of the world seeing it happen. This is the emotional place the protestors are coming from - this is an emergency, and people who are complicit are still getting positive press through things like sponsoring pride, an event which started as liberation from oppression. 

I think theres a way to engage that can result in both groups benefiting ultimately. It would likely take a lot of reaching out, and genuine engagement with the concerns raised - ie how do their concerns align with what we are trying to accomplish with pride? Twenty, fifty years from now - how would you want this pride to be remembered?

AQuietBorderline,,,"My money goes to Phillip Hapsburg (Mary‚Äôs husband).

He was a real peach. Not only was he so cold to all of his wives (he had four of them altogether) that his own father had to tell him to be kind to his first wife. His smile was described as like ice. 

He also may or may not have had a hand in the death of his son and heir Don Carlos. Although to be fair, Don Carlos was described as a raging lunatic who was cruel and took pleasure in hurting animals and then people‚Ä¶all signs of the calamities that would befall the inbreeding that was to follow.

But Phillip was not happy when he learned that he basically had no political power in England, made overtures to his sister in law (Elizabeth) and was humiliated by Mary‚Äôs psychosomatic pregnancy that he more or less dumped her, going back to Spain for at least a year.

Then he came back for a brief visit‚Ä¶bringing his mistress with him. Phillip asked oh so pretty please with a cherry on top for Mary to fund his campaign in France. Mary, desperate for him back in her life, agreed and Phillip left, never to return.

Mary ended up losing Calais (the last English stronghold in France) as a result and threw herself into the burnings. By this point she was most likely dying from uterine cancer.

When she died, Phillip said, in essence, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry she died‚Äù before proposing to Elizabeth. She turned him down.

While your post doesn‚Äôt go into details on what's going to happen to your beloved ""soul dog"" or if you have family, friends, or a support network, I gotta believe there's somebody in this world who cares about you, the pain you're feeling & what you're going through. Even though your post leaves much unsaid, I want you to know that I care about you & your feelings about losing your beloved pup on July 3rd. Most importantly, your post seemed to mention another dog that you have (""she's 11"") that still needs & cares about you. I also believe others here on this Reddit post care too.


Like you, I'm single, no kids, in pain (some emotional, but mostly from age & a thyroid that decided to go kablooey a few years ago). But my faith along with my furry family‚Äîa rascally 9-year-old pup I adopted from my local animal shelter & 7(!) mischievous cats (please, no""crazy cat lady"" jokes)‚Äîhelp me find joy each day, even during tough times.


I understand the indescribable pain of losing a furry family member. Before my current little¬† monkeys, I had a gentle & sweet little furry pup who was my best friend. He passed away from cancer in 2013 after enduring multiple surgeries & chemo. Mercifully, he passed away in my arms, sparing me the gut-wrenching decision to euthanize him (it was scheduled). It's been over 10 years, but my love & thoughts of him remain just as strong.


Recently, on May 31st, I lost my little 'OG' angel cat, also to cancer. She was almost 13. I'm trying not to cry now as I remember the light slowly leaving her beautiful eyes, as she too passed away in my arms, a mere hour before the vet was due at my home to euthanize her. The pain from losing them both is heavy, but I'm grateful for the family, friends, and people who care about me. And most importantly, my furry babies who unconditionally love & need me.


To help cope with the loss & begin healing, I started volunteering at my local animal shelter back in 2013. That‚Äôs how I ended up becoming a 'foster failure' & adopted my current pup in late 2014. The uncomplicated,¬† unconditional love, faithfulness & simple companionship of our furry babies is hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it & just don't know.


But I understand, and I care. Jonm61 please hang on; reach out for help when/if you need it, be gentle with yourself, and after July 3rd, please try to hold onto all the wonderful memories of the good times & love you shared with your beloved ""soul dog.""",0,1719813525,,,0,lb389ox,t3_1drq0gk,t1_laxoj65,1719813540,2,False,Veterans,t5_2rc75

Silentxgold,,,"Hi Op, Agent here.


How I would advise my clients when they are considering CI.


1.does their company provide any coverage 


2. Do they have a family history of critical illness


3. How many years of income replacement do they want in the event of Eci and Ci


Early critical illness is more easily treated and lesser recovery time vs. late stage where treatment could be more invasion, longer treatment period and recovery period. 


So a ball park would be 6 months to 3 years of your income for early Ci and 4 years up for late stage.


It would be better if you split the required coverage of $300k


To maybe $100k eci for 2 years of income and $200k Ci for 4 years of your income.


If your main concern is cancer, stroke and heart attack can just buy specific big 3 insurance.


Ge,aia,pru has the highest premium when compared to other insurance companies, so you would save money in the long run if you at least check out quotes from other companies.",0,1719813938,,,0,lb38wsc,t3_1dslg0c,t3_1dslg0c,1719813954,1,False,singaporefi,t5_36z35

I know I shouldn't listen to people but I feel that their opinions would also find their way towards my husband and someday my daughter, so idk what to teach her. Should I build her hopes up? Or should I just tell her the truth and tell her to have low expectations in how men will see her if she gets a career?

Also, I think it's unfair that this may possibly be the only life on this earth that we have and it would be a waste just being a housewife... it just doesn't seem fair and I don't want to be on my deathbed reflecting on how unsuccessful and routine my life has been simply because I chose to listen to a bunch of traditionalist family members.

Its a hard one to say, because to a Christian who actually follows the bible, having cancer or continuing to fight and having faith of god is literally what the entire religion is based around. The bible describes those as ""tests of faith"", and a Christian believes that god who can end our suffering allegedly at any moment, willingly makes us suffer anyway to see if we will stay loyal to him until we finally die and if yes,  then the bible says thats how you earn your spot in heaven . Even though god apparently knows everything so then he would know how we would react before making us suffer pointlessly. So take that as you will i guess.

GlitteringYams,,‚≠ê,"Oh you can absolutely fuck right off. This is such a cold, calloused response, it's mind boggling. Like I'm absolutely livid. You literally care more about the comfort of the parents than the wellbeing of OOP. This isn't about the parents, that baby isn't theirs. They're not obligated to pay a fucking dime or waste a second of their time on that baby. They could disown OOP if they wanted to, plenty of parents kick out their pregnant daughters, it isn't exactly uncommon. 

The idea of taking a newborn baby away from another who loves it and wants it is so horrific to me that I can barely stomach it. And you think it's an appropriate way to teach a child that actions have consequences? 

I can, on some level, understand the concern. Being a single mom is *hard*. You know what else is hard? Losing a child. What do you think is going to happen after OOP gives birth? Do you think she'll just... Snap back to the way she was before? Nothing is every going to be the same after she gives birth. She's going to experience pain for weeks as her uterus returns to its normal size. She may suffer from post partum depression. Hell, how do you think she's going to feel when she pumps, then has to dump out all the milk because there isn't a baby to give it to? Do you think that shit isn't going to affect her psyche?

How do you think a mother feels when she miscarries or delivers a stillborn? How do you think a mother feels when she finds out that cord wrapped around the baby's throat and strangled it in delivery? How she feels when she finds out her preemie didn't make it? When she walks into the nursery to discover that her baby has died of SIDS? When OOP gives up that baby, it will be gone from her life forever. She will never see it again. She will never get to raise it, never get to see it's first steps or hear it's first words, there will never be Christmases or mother's days, or 4 of Julys. No lullabies, no little babies shoes, no nothing. Do you think that her grief will be any less real, any less tangible? Do you really think that the memory of the baby won't haunt her forever? Sure, she knows she has to give it up, but do you really think that will make it any easier or less traumatic? Knowing the inevitable doesn't make things less painful. Mothers who lose children to terminal cancer aren't somehow less traumatized than mothers who lose their babies in car crashes. 

OOP's parents don't want to raise the baby? Great, they don't have to. They can put their foot down, they can set boundaries, they can evict her. If she *chooses* to keep the baby, they can *choose* to do whatever the hell they want if they don't want anything to do with it. 

But they do not have the right to make the choice to keep the baby. It isn't their decision to make. They *cannot* force her to give birth, let her become attached and fall in love with the child, then force her to give it away when she loves it and wants it. That's despicable. They cannot strip her of that choice. Everybody's so worried that she's going to raise the baby and regret it. What if she gives the baby away and regrets it? What if she gives the baby away and it alters the trajectory of the rest of her life? 

Just because she's young, doesn't mean that she isn't a person. It's her body, her baby. We shouldn't be focusing on how *inconvenient* this might be for the parents. Their signature isn't the one on the paper. They're forcing her to pick which family is going to take her baby away. Literally the idea of how that must feel makes me nauseated.

Had a radical open procedure with vertical cut. I was bleeding to death. 3 ER trips. I had a D&C, unfortunately, that made my body decide to clot up (but not stop bleeding of course!) I developed a saddle PE and 2 DVTs in my leg. My local hospital decided to take the PE out, as it was going to kill me if they did not. They also did a uterine artery embolization while I was under to staunch the bleeding hopefully and gave me 5 units of blood. They didn't have gyn/onc available, so they were trying to transfer me to mine, an hour away. That hospital rejected me. My gyn/onc was down in LA for the holidays (Thanksgiving) and unavailable. They tried UCSF. They said no, because my D&C was clear of cancer. Last minute at 1am, Stanford had a free bed. So my hospital put me in an ambulance at 1am for a 4 to 5 hour drive. Super! It was late November, I was in only a gown, and the ambulance heater was broken. (I am THAT lucky!) I did get there alive however! Stanford tried to stabilize me, topped up my tank with another unit of blood, and set to figuring out wtf was wrong with me. They tested the shit out of me for 5 days. I was beginning to wonder if I was just a guinea pig. It sucked because I was utterly alone. Far from home and no friends or family near. On day 4.5 it was grim, because I wasn't getting stable enough for the hysto I needed. Another unit of blood given.  At 6am on day 5, I sneezed. Something popped and I started gushing blood. I called the nurse. She looked and was shook. She grabbed her phone and started taking pictures of my crotch to send to the doctors. By 9am I was being wheeled to the OR, and told that I may not make it, it was very risky, but I had no other choice. Cue me uncontrollable sobbing. My little sister saved the day and drove my mom the 5 hour trip up to be there just before my surgery. Only one day though.

I woke up! I don't remember much! I had cancer confirmed. I spent 5 days in-patient after surgery and then took a transport ambulance home.....super not fun to ride that long with a giant open belly wound!

It left me paralyzed on my left side. I was/am still learning to walk again. My bitch uterus set me back real far! I can walk, but not well or far. I move like I'm really drunk all the time.

jaco361g,,Doctor :Daan:,"Moonscorching is likely the manifestation of the victim‚Äôs insecurities. I‚Äôll try explaining every single moonscorched contestant (some of these explanations are lifted from my other comments on other Reddit posts and YouTube videos, so some of these explanations might sound really familiar) The ones that I think have more obvious symbolism I‚Äôll try to keep brief, while the more subtle ones I‚Äôll elaborate more on.


I‚Äôll start with Tanaka since his moonscorched form ‚ÄúJudgement‚Äù not only has it information important to his moonscrched form, but gives us a better understanding of the others as well.

The glass shards in his body are a reference to him breaking the glass ceiling, which is a term used for when the barrier for advancement in businesses (often affecting women and minorities) is broken through. (Tanaka is asian, so I guess racism exists in the F&H world) Judement sounds confident in his dialogue, so some people interpret that he‚Äôs happy with his career, and that he‚Äôs proud of what he had to endure to achieve it. However that‚Äôs clearly not the case. Even if you ignore the self harm whip he carries, and the torture device around his neck, Tanaka's notes looted from Judements corpse tell us this: 

*‚ÄùI tried to fool myself. Deny the inevitable. There's no mistaking it anymore. I've felt it inside me for few days now. What happened to Marcoh and everyone else in this cursed land... I know I'm next. The gut wrenching nausea deep within me... It's growing... Fast... All my memories and regrets... They become increasingly heavy. It's a burden that is almost too much to bear. I now understand why Marcoh succumbed to the madness. It truly is a fate worse than death.‚Äù*

Judement is a manifestation of Tanaka's regrets, his character arc throughout the festival has made it more obvious how much of his life he‚Äôs wasted during something that he didn‚Äôt enjoy. This makes it clear that 1) even if a moonscorhed victim's dialogue sounds happy, they‚Äôre likely not, and analyzing the symbolism is more important. And 2) that moonscorhing is a fate worse than death.


Marcoh becomes the giant. Daan's medical diagnosis skill explains that the harden body is formed like cancer tissue. Maroch's guilt from having murdered someone, manifested like cancer eating him from the inside. The giant holds a man in his hand, who he either pounds in the floor, or throws at the player, showing Maroch's fear of how easily he can use his larger body to bully others.


Henryk becomes the Gentleman, which shows Henryk's insecurities as a failed artist. Henryk says that views his cooking as his art. Since we know his artist career went nowhere, it's likely that he tries to maintain some artistic craft in his food to keep himself content with his life. However the fact that the Gentleman's ‚Äúfood‚Äù is sexual and meaningless implies that he doubts this ‚Äúartistic food‚Äù talk deep down. It might seem like the Gentleman oblivious to how disgusting the ""food"" is from his dialogue, however if we think about Judgment and Tanaka's notes, it‚Äôs likely that the Gentleman is the same type of case. The Gentleman may say that he‚Äôs a artistic man, but it actually shows that Henryk is self conscious about his art, food and possibly the fact he's 32 and single. Given he kidnaps Marina and the sexual ‚Äúfood‚Äù


Caligura becomes Monster, which symbolizes his need to be and feel above others, and the insecurities as to why. It‚Äôs due his fear of being seen his little (shown by the Monster's dialogue if you use persuade on it) likely because of some past trauma. He clearly cares about his appearance, his white suit would be harder to keep clean, and his hair is well groomed. (He feels disgusted by his appearance shown by the warts covering Monster's body, and the sexual appearance of them shows to me that deep down he knows his actions are self destructive) He‚Äôs also clearly paranoid, seen by his Interaction with Marcoh. That fact Caligura moonscorched in the sewer is likely because when he was traveling through it, it made him feel extra disgusting, little, paranoid, and below others both physically and mentally.


Olivia becomes the Mechanical Dance. Olivia likes to be one with nature, but she fears that her wheelchair makes her half human, half machine. When the mechanical dance ‚Äúvents out,‚Äù it looks like she‚Äôs breathing through where her wheelchair used to be, symbolizing her shame that she has to rely on it as much as she does. (There‚Äôs also some possible implications to her being overshadowed by Relia, but that‚Äôs not the primary insecurity behind the Mechanical Dance)


Karin becomes the Valkyrie. The Valkyrie symbolizes her guilt of the fact she profits from the suffering of others as a journalist, fearing she‚Äôs no better than the corrupt authorities she‚Äôs constantly criticizing. While the form is called Valkyrie, it looks more like a vulture, symbolizing her cognitive dissonance, and the fear she‚Äôs actually a vulture masquerading as a just Valkyrie. There‚Äôs armor plating covering her eyes, likely showing her feeling like she has to blind herself from the truth of her profession.


Marina becomes the Cocoon, which symbolizes her fear of being a puppet of her father. While Marina didn‚Äôt become a dark priest, she still ended up becoming on occultist, which is pretty similar. She also went back to Prehevil because of a letter her father sent. Her original head has become a carrier for a phallic looking cocoon, and a new head has grown between her legs, symbolizing her gender dysphoria and her fear of going down the path her father wanted to follow unintentionally.


Samarie becomes Dysmorphia, which is named after body dysmorphia. Body dysmorphia usually means the person suffering from it perceives their body in a exaggerated negative way, that doesn‚Äôt reflect how the actually look for everyone else. Dysmorphia's head being split open is symbolic of how Samarie's ‚Äúradiant soul needs‚Äù are being suppressed by her self loathing. Every time she tries initiating a conversation with Marina or father Domek, she almost immediately loses confidence. Dysmorphia's head is spilt open also shows the pain that she feels when others observe her body and face, thinking they‚Äôre judging her every move. Dysmorphia dialogue sounds confident, but it comes off as desperate and contrasts the appearance greatly, similar to Judgement. The peeled open head is also similar in appearance to the janitor's back and Logic's hair, and she describes herself as: *‚ÄúLike a moth! I'm finally close to bloom! A hairy moth in the night!‚Äú* Moths are connected to Logic, which likely hints to her past of forcefully being connected to the old gods. The armored body of Dysmorphia, is likely also symbolic of her scared body from her time in the ninth circle of Fiend Petr's Basilica.",0,1719816000,,,0,lb3c1nu,t3_1dscv1e,t3_1dscv1e,1719816016,1,False,FearAndHunger,t5_uoe16
bulbasauuuur,,,"Well I‚Äôm glad to hear he‚Äôs getting treatment. That early in treatment is still tough though. 

The issue is being gentle isn‚Äôt really what is best for either of you. Being assertive about how you feel is still important, and you can be understanding without babying him. I would think more it‚Äôs just like messages saying you‚Äôre thinking of him and hope he‚Äôs doing well without the expectation of a reply. This is assuming you communicate other ways besides text, too. Texting might be harder than other ways. If this texting is the only way you communicate, the issue would be a lot different.

A lot of people are jumping to weird conclusions about cheating and that he doesn‚Äôt care about you. They literally know nothing about him except a couple of texts, so don‚Äôt listen to all that since you know your relationship far better.

I also saw you say he tries to appease his dad because of how his dad treated him growing up. I honestly relate a lot with your boyfriend, except I‚Äôm a woman and it was with my mom, and I even had times where my depression was too overwhelming to talk to the people I loved most.  Does he have a plan to move out of his dad‚Äôs house? I‚Äôve been in treatment for my mental illnesses for nearly 2 decades now but nothing improved my life as much as moving out of my mom‚Äôs house did. I highly encourage he take that step sooner rather than later. I assume money is an issue, but seriously, it‚Äôs worth figuring it out. It‚Äôs worth it to have a less comfortable physical space and not have the mental strain of a parent like that. It is freeing in a way I never could‚Äôve imagined. I‚Äôd rather eat nothing but ramen noodles because that‚Äôs all I can afford than live with my mom again. 

The thing about a relationship is it can‚Äôt always be 50/50. Sometimes one person will need more support and can‚Äôt offer support. Sometimes it will switch. As long as the overall balance feels 50/50 then it still is fair. I really appreciate the people in my life that stuck with me through my worst periods of depression. Now that I‚Äôm able, I support them, help them, and am active in maintaining the relationships. I know how it can feel bad for the person who is trying to stick with someone with a mental illness and how it can feel like they don‚Äôt care about you at times, though. I know how my depression hurt people in my life too. But really, if someone was sick with cancer or something, no one would expect they‚Äôd be up for texting constantly. Bipolar disorder can be deadly and just as draining. 

So yeah, I guess I would say your feelings definitely do matter but I would consider the overall relationship more than this one incident. Consider if he put in effort when he could other times, or try to get through this now and see how his behavior is as he starts recovery

She got him through rehab (which was rare in the late 70's), he let her have full control over his finances, they did not even live together at that point. When he finally had his shit together and moved in a few years into their relationship, he proposed to her but not in a romantic way - her doing jobs left and right whereever she could make some money and taking care of the kids she had no savings or anything prepared for rent in any sort, he already helped with utility bills (at least she got the house from my gramps attested to her by court - who was by then a wealthy lawyer but otherwise wouldnt give her a penny, maybe buy the kids some clothes at times)

He did love her but could never find the words for it as he did not experience love for the first 35 years of his life, which were miserable. So he proposed to her calling it ""securing her"", saving taxes, less paperwork, etc. She said she is not going to accept a proposal under these aspects.

Thank you for sharing, BTW. You and your family sound a lot like me and mine. The main difference is that I had a sister, and she was a good person until she died of cancer.

I am looking into my PTSD as if it's C-PTSD. For now, I'm trying to avoid psychiatrists (who are way worse than psychologists) while I deal with my blackout issue.

Ultimately, I blame the DSM for oversimplifying everything. I might have ASD, be neurodivergant, C-PTSD, Dabrowski's Overexitibilities, or have some or all of the above. All I know is that, like you, I'm gifted and have faced extreme adversity for being different. Perhaps one day, if I'm still interested, I can undergo those tests.

Wide_Ad_3256,,,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, it hurts like hell. Watching someone slowly die of cancer has been so incredibly painful for me. Since I am the only person my father has, it has come with a lot of responsibility. I have been on autopilot for months, taking him to appointments, chemo, doing the grocery shopping, cleaning and cooking. Making memories was important to me since my father and daughter are close. We had ice cream parties, tea parties, watched funny movies, went for drives or just laid on his bed with him and told each other funny stories. Now that I have been given the prognosis of 2 weeks to a month and we are at the end, those memories will forever make me smile. I am glad I was able to leave my job and take care of my dad. I am glad he knows how loved he is and he feels cared about. I have already grieved him in many ways. He is not very aware now and the dementia has gotten bad. This has been the hardest step yet, but also there is a certain peace knowing he won‚Äôt be suffering for much longer. I hope you can make peace with it. Know you did your best, make sure she knows how loved she is, make sure you have a voice message saved from her and you take pics. If you can, maybe take her for a drive? Go get an ice cream cone or read a story to her. Remember to breathe. Remember to be kind to yourself.

Upstairs-Aerie-4909,,Historical Legend,"Hi again John/MrBallen

We're coming to see you in Dallas!!

My sister and I will be there to see you start your tour! üòÉüëè¬†

When you first announced your tour,¬† I went on the link and had the Meet and¬†Greet tickets in my cart.¬† But, when I clicked to purchase them, the screen refreshed and said that they'd sold.¬† Which was a total bummer.¬†

But! It takes more then that to get me down  :)

I was able to secure a couple really great presale seats thanks to your Ballen code.¬† ¬†Thank you!¬† ¬†We're looking forward to seeing/hearing you tell your stories in person!!¬† :)

I'll be able to combine coming to see you with visiting with mom as she continues to fight her cancer.¬† She wasn't up for coming due to her chemo, but looks forward to being there vicariously.

Regarding our previous communication about Dad, I realized that I'd neglected to tell you what Dad appreciated most about you and your story telling.¬†

He greatly admired your service as a Navy SEAL.¬† ¬†And as I said previosly, he loved learning more about Clint Eastwood/Samson and his time in the military and Fort Ord, plane crash etc through your expert story telling.¬†

While in college Dad was in the ROTC and went in as an Officer after college.¬† He was stationed in Japan and Germany during Vietnam and ultimately returned to the states to serve as Company Commander at the Defense Language Institute a few miles from Fort Ord.¬† After a total of 19 years of service in the Army he was honorably discharged as a Captain.¬†

After his Military time,¬† he went on to have his 38 year career with Pebble Beach Company where he worked with/for Clint Eastwood.

Dad is now at the Veterans Cemetary in Seaside,¬† California along with Michael, who passed at 25 months.¬† ¬†The Cemetary is about 5 minutes from where I live and I'm grateful they're nearby.¬†

If you ultimately plan to tour on the West Coast,¬† specifically Monterey Bay area or anywhere in California,¬† I'll be one of the first to buy a Meet and Greet ticket.¬† And meet you in person then ü§û:)

I loved watching your documentary!¬† So well done!¬† It was so great to see how much your family, your wife and your kids have supported you in your journey.¬† :)¬†¬†

Even though it's a very different topic,¬† it reminded me of a documentary short I wrote and produced in college and the short film I wrote/reintepreted and co-produced with a couple friends a few years later. :)

Please tell your family and team that you all nailed it! Full on nailed it with Becoming Mr Ballen! Well done! üëè

Thank you again for your honest transparency about your mental health and sobriety challenges.¬† And your kind words,¬† condolences and prayers for me and my family.¬† ¬†I'm sending the same to you and yours too!¬† And for safe travels for all on your tour team.¬†¬†

Again, you are an inspiration and have helped so many people be honest and transparent with themselves and improve their own lives and the lives of the people they love :)


I believe in you in your sobriety, mental health and your continued work!¬†¬†


And yes, you can and will survive a month on a tour bus! :)

Thank you for being you and for all you do.¬† ¬†I look forward to seeing you in person soon in Dallas :)

A solid tumor was discovered in his right testicle (he went to the doc for testicular pain over a year ago and was told it was¬† likely a cyst and would go away) and an over 15 cm mass in his abdomen , retroperitoneaol space.¬† Three days later we saw an urology oncologist scheduled a removal and biopsy of the right testicle a few days later April 1st, but said we'd hit the tumor in his abdomen with chemotherapy and hopefully shrink it enough to remove because it was inoperable at the size it was.¬† He had the surgery to remove the testicle and biopsy results showed a NSGT, pure mature teratoma.¬† Now Teratoma 100% mature teratoma are malignant of you're past puberty.¬† Obviously he is.¬† It was taken for granted that the tumor in his abdomen was also Teratoma and Teratoma is resistant to Chemotherapy and Radiation;¬† the only option was to remove a huge inoperable tumor that's growing in a very risky place.¬† The surgery is scheduled for April 19th.¬† Told its a 6 hour surgery.¬† This surgery turned into a 14 hour surgery because removal caused his Aorta, ilieum (a major artery that turns to femoral artery a little further down( and all the vessels to his right kidney to tear.¬† His Aorta and Ilium had to be rebuilt and his right kidney was removed.¬† The tumor was also attached to his spine.¬† My son required multiple (10) blood transfusions and came out of surgery on life support and taken to ICU.¬† He woke 2 days later and was in the hospital 2 weeks, required several weeks of physical and occupational therapy, but doing better than expected. Biopsy results came back for the tumor that took so long because it was sent to IU and Dr. Einhorn for a second opinion.¬† They couldn't believe what they saw;¬† the inside, or the tumor that was attached to his Aorta was a Neuroendocrine tumor. Not a NSGT;¬† and all around it was NSGT, teratoma type.¬† So, 60% Teratoma, 40% NET.¬† We saw Dr. Einhorn a week later. He ordered another CT scan, were about 5 weeks post surgery.¬† He does feel we need chemotherapy right away.¬† CT results come back and it's in the lymph nodes in his neck, liver and throughout lungs.¬† He needs very strong chemo.¬† He needs probably 6 cycles and each cycle lasts 21 days.¬† On day one he was admitted and given Red Devil chemo, which can only be given one dose every 21 days, followed by a mixture of 3 different chemos for 5 days straight.¬† He has weekends off. And release the combo of 3 for 3 weeks in a row, then he gets a week off and repeat hospitalization for 5 days, with the first day being red devil, then he starts the other 3 combo. One cycle for him is 17 chemo treatments.¬† He just completed his first week of his second cycle on Friday . He's very sick, but we were told that he's going to be very sick. His prognosis was great, but this other cancer is throwing a wrench.¬† Honestly, we don't know that¬† this is going to works for him.¬† Dr.¬† Einhorn gives him about a 65% chance of surviving what they're calling metastatic Testicular Neuroendocrine Carcinoma associated with¬† teratoma, retroperitoneaol space and my son is the only documented case of these two types of cancer being together in the retroperitoneaol space and his oncologist where we live that actually oversees his chemo says he just isn't sure that it will work and if it doesn't, there aren't any other options.¬† He has a very aggressive and fast spreading case.¬† There's a lot of unknowns at this point and nobody to compare him to, but I know he's been through way too much in such a short period of time and has already beat the odds with this disease and the major and complicated¬† surgery it required to get him to where he is now that it has to work.¬† We are keeping the faith.¬† Attitude is everything.¬†¬†",0,1719818893,,,0,lb3g8ou,t3_11u0642,t3_11u0642,1719818911,1,False,testicularcancer,t5_348dl

She was my best friend and it hurts when I want to share something with her and realise that she isn‚Äôt there anymore. Even I find myself dwelling on what could have been and what I should have done differently, but I'm starting to realize that's just part of life. 

Perhaps your mom wouldn't have wanted you to see her in the hospital. It's a difficult memory to carry. I'm struggling too, especially after seeing her uncomfortable there. But those hospital days were just a small part of her very full life. She must have had so many happy moments, especially with you. You were there for her through thick and thin, and that's what truly matters. You stayed in the same house as her!!! Which is something a lot of parents long for. You gave your mom the best care possible and your mom knew you had your reasons. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. 

Gather all your photos, cherish those cute texts, and honor her memory. While it's unfair and painful, it always could have been even worse. We can be grateful she's no longer suffering.

GenjiVEVO,,Austria,"That wasn't a problem for me at all. My sister and I both moved away from our countries right after finishing school, so my parents are used to it. I decided to go to Germany for my studied because I used to be in a long distance relationship with a German. My grandma got cancer in the months leading up to my move, so she was really sad/mad that I wanted to go (""you are betraying your home country""). Before she died she actually told me she was proud of me for moving and she even suggested to pay for better accomodation (as i called my mom crying when i moved in a shared student apartment and it was so disgustingly dirty).

I visit my family 2-3 times a year now. I broke up with my ex who I moved to Germany for just one month after I got there. While at university I met my current girlfriend of 5 years, who also came to Japan with me and now lives with me in Austria.

No_Use1529,,,"Going to add this. I had the chance to let my ex die or seriously end up hurt several times.  Heck she‚Äôd have killed herself  intentionally a couple times if I let her‚Ä¶. Stab, shoot herself or OD take your pick. I went through it all. 

Technically tried  to stab  me, shoot me and kill us both in her car before I refused to ever get in a vehicle with her again.  The if she couldn‚Äôt have me no one could. I got told that several times.

It was a sick twisted nightmare. I wanted off the damn ride from hell so  badly. Times I thought I was going to die on it, to never escape her.

She was using something intentionally to induce extreme breathing issues. Obviously inhaling something. She brought it on as quick as she went into bathroom and coming out not even a minute later it seemed. Barely making it to the front door as I was trying to walk out that same door and collapsing at my feet. This wasn‚Äôt a fake it. It was real and serious medical duress ‚Ä¶.

It was a form of her using it to control me and get me to stay, get her help and be by her side instead of finally leaving like I was trying to do.  Because I was a good person and always tired to do the right thing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I wasn‚Äôt and am not perfect. Nor a saint. 

When I found out she died. I looked into it. 

Wana take a guess how she died? Yup‚Ä¶. 

So apparently her affair partner wasn‚Äôt a knight in shining armor after all.

Shut  the door and left her‚Ä¶ 

Obviously the info I info I found didn‚Äôt say that exactly. She was found near her front door the morning after allegedly suffering a serve asthma attack the evening before was what I found. She  a few days later.  

I will put money how it all really went down though‚Ä¶. She never had those ‚Äúattacks‚Äù unless I was trying to leave her for good. Thats when she was not threatening to get me falsely arrested if I walked out the door. Which was more often than not. Same with trying to stab or shoot me. Shed immediately start hitting herself as soon as I got her disarmed and I went for the phone to call 911z she‚Äôd do the try it and let‚Äôs see who they believe. It‚Äôs your career you  loose if you get arrested she‚Äôd  say with a smirk.

I was proud of myself for always doing the right thing at that moment. Oh yeah the through crossed my mind multiple times. It would have been an escape from her and a lot less messier than a divorce. I knew she‚Äôd make any divorce hell and do her best to ruin me further (which she did). She was not a good person.  Told me she was going to have her cake and eat it too. When I confronted her about the cheating and telling her it was the final straw. We were done‚Ä¶ All the other crap she promised to stop she was back to doing too. But she made it clear to me, this was going to be my life. Like it or not‚Ä¶ She wasn‚Äôt stopping any of it ever. So all that played in my mind. Oh yeah, I knew it was the easy out. 

Side note. I think non stop and race through scenarios quickly. It‚Äôs natural for me  and I never learned how to shut it down until recently. Worked great for my career and the military‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs  also a curse at times. Lot of wasted and needless thoughts with all that what if bs‚Ä¶when it‚Äôs pointless..or I‚Äôd never do it anyways‚Ä¶.‚Äô

That‚Äôs exactly how I escaped from her finally, but I put her on an ambulance and ran for my life literally (grabbed a go bag and ran)‚Ä¶. Let her play the victim and how dare I leave her. But damn it she was safe in medical staff hands and I was done being threatened be it my life or my career with a false arrest.  Done being with a cheater and someone who was intentionally trying to break me like a wild horse‚Ä¶I firmly believe she took pleasure in trying to break me. I suspect that‚Äôs what her mom did to her dad.

I look back and no regrets I did the right thing every time‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt live with having done that. 

If I had tried to tell the paramedics or hospital staff what she did. She would have found a way to blurt out the ‚Äúhe beats me‚Äù bullchit. Learned that lesson the hard way. And when they go into that mode not a damn one of them ever listened to what I was saying. Thankfully instead of calling 911‚Äô, I just got removed from  the hospital. One of local cops that showed up on scene for the ambulance  calls was definitely looking for a chance to jam up a man first chance she could  for a domestic battery legit or not‚Ä¶ My ex would just smile when she showed up. Like see how close you are to losing everything.

When a doctor told me she never had  cancer (faked cancer and treatment to get me to stay at one point too) she was trying to get pain meds for her ‚Äúcancer‚Äù pain.  Doc disappeared for 40 mins to an hour..  He came back pulled me aside and did the she never had cancer. He‚Äôs positive.  Then he dropped the munchowesen word. Then confronted her. She let out an evil vile screech, jumped on her phone. It wasn‚Äôt 20 minutes I swear it was so damn fast it was insane. She was being wheeled out by a private ambulance service and taken to another hospital.. I have never seen anything like that in my life!!!!!

No way that was the first time‚Ä¶. Why I say I‚Äôd love to talk with her ex fianc√© and see all what he experienced too. She honed these skills on someone else before me. 

So I tried  to get the second hospital to call the first one and talk to the doctor. Soon as she found out, she did  ‚Äúthe he beats me‚Äù and I found myself being escorted out of the hospital and mother F‚Äôd.  Got a hold of the first doc and begged him to call. Yeah dude it‚Äôs safer for us to wash our hands. Can‚Äôt you put this is the notes you send over? No‚Ä¶ Not our hot potato any more.  She‚Äôs not our problem and we are leaving this dead horse lay!!!!! Sorry you are sol‚Ä¶.

Despite all that anger and hatred I did the right things to the best of my ability. Felt like I failed at times‚Ä¶ That bothered me. I told her parents multiple times she needed help and that they needed  to help me get her help. They said they understood. But that help never came. But can‚Äôt risk mommies monster tells how she became the way she was. 

My conscious is clean‚Ä¶
I hope it haunts her affair partner at night what he did. But not my circus not my monkeys anymore either.

Somerandom1922,,,"Hypergolic propellants are a super annoying part of rocketry. Their special property is the fact that they automatically ignite on contact with each other.  


This makes them unbelievably desirable, particularly for rockets which need to be kept on standby for a long time, because they tend to be stable at room temperature, you don't need any crazy complex ignition systems in your engine, and they're nearly as reliable as you can get without using solid propellant or monopropellant, while offering far better performance. You will often see hyperbolics used for orbital manoeuvring thrusters, like the space shuttles OMS, the Apollo lunar lander engines etc. When you need it to work, but you need more performance than a basic hydrogen peroxide or cold gas thruster, you use hypergolics.  


The kicker is that almost every hypergolic that has those traits is also absurdly carcinogenic, toxic, and downright shitty to deal with.   


UDMH (Unsymmetrical\_dimethylhydrazine), often just called hydrazine (although that can refer to a broader class of hypergolic propellants) is the standard go-to and is just absolute cancer/nerve agent/skin melty juice as the comment above pointed out. That's mostly ok when it's only used in deep space, or in ICBMS (at that point you've got bigger issues than a slow death from UDMH), but when your primary launch vehicle like the Chinese Long March family use hydrazine propellants in the first stage, and when those first stages are **INTENDED** to land back on land near isolated mountain villages, that's an issue. Particularly as there's always residual UDMH and oxidizer (either nitric acid in the early days, or Dinitrogen Tetroxide these days) still in the booster tanks which, if it doesn't directly reach people can still leach into ground water.",0,1719819742,,,0,lb3hfcc,t3_1ds4gd2,t1_lb0bgwj,1719819760,3,False,NonCredibleDefense,t5_i41xc

DO_Kagome,,,"How do you go through life after that period of what you see as a failure? Let's just say my mom turned me against my dad, she divorced him after his accident, abandoned me and I became homeless at 16. Got into a fine mess in life and did a lot of things I wish I didn't. I am now a medical student about to be a doctor. 

How do you get through it? By holding that head high. And by high, I mean in the clouds my man. I can't tell you how proud I am of the time you've been sober. That time period in your life does not define you. Those are not failure; they are obstacles that you successfully overcame. Face what happens with your chin up and know that you are beautiful, strong, and most importantly, worth it.

Moving forward, find better cooing mechanisms. Part of what got me out of my mess was researching ""humanistic psychology"". It's about being the best YOU that you can be. It's self centered and focuses on mastering your potential. I really recommend it as it has done wonders in my life. Talk to your therapist about it and let him/her know your interest. 

To further talk, my specialty is oncology. I am going to be a cancer doctor and grief/death is quite literally my life. Watching patients slowly die while they beg you for life is not easy. So take my advice and look towards humanistic principles. Love yourself. Believe in yourself. Trust yourself.

They know we are trying unsuccessfully, and maybe it's just me but I felt like it was in the air every time we played with him or held him. I am sure the yearning was just beaming. I was kind of embarrassed to be honest. We did talk about it for a bit with them but you know facts only, without mentioning how we struggle emotionally.

And it sucks. They are both heavy weed addicts, he has one testicle after a surgery for cancer, she is overweight, their eating habits are the worst (lots of sugar, sugary drinks, junk food multiple times a week). They don't work out at all. And I know all that because we used to hang out together a lot when we lived in the same city, before the baby was born. We used to come over a at least a couple times a week. And fuck.  It took them 3 months to get pregnant. They both never gave up the weed, she continued all through the pregnancy and even now when she still breastfeeds. I even initiated a conversation with her at her second trimester, about how dangerous the smoking is when the baby's brain is developing.  But she didn't quit! And now they have the cutest baby, so pretty and smiley.

Meanwhile, here we are doing everything we can, have a healthy lifestyle, no smoking no drinking, working out, eating well. Taking vitamins. Trying for a baby for 8 months now and nothing. I have an appointment soon and honestly I think I am going to lie... And tell the doc we've been trying for a year. Because I can't take it anymore.

JDuggernaut,,,"No, I would seek a second opinion, because doctors are sometimes wrong. A doctor once wanted to perform open heart surgery on my mother to remove a tumor. As it turns out, other doctors confirmed she didn‚Äôt have a tumor. My step grandfather was told he was fine and probably strained too much at work and that was why he was peeing blood. When it happened again two years later, other doctors confirmed he had stage 4 prostate cancer that had spread. He died from it. My aunt was born with cancer and a whole series of doctors told my grandparents she seemed fine and they couldn‚Äôt figure out why she was in pain. Finally a doctor realized she had cancer. She fought for a couple of years before she died at the age of 3. They aren‚Äôt always right.

I don‚Äôt doubt humans have some amount of impact on the environment, but why is the impact of natural geologic processes never addressed or considered when discussing the matter? Long before humans, there were periods where the Earth was covered with ice, periods where it was completely unfrozen, and periods where it was basically a fireball. We technically live in an Ice Age even now since we have polar ice caps. How much of the issue is just Earth doing what Earth always does? There was always going to be a time when all the ice melted and the temperatures got hotter and the earth entered a greenhouse period. So how much of our current situation is due to the inevitability of Earth‚Äôs natural processes? Scientists say it is virtually impossible for the Earth to turn into a Venus-like runaway greenhouse regardless of human activity, so what real impact can we make by completely upheaving society as we know it?

""Pyrethroid long-term effects on human health also still remain unclear (Feo et al., 2010, Kolaczinski and Curtis, 2004) but exposure to these compounds has nevertheless been shown to cause some adverse effects, especially for children and pregnant women (ATSDR, 2003). Pyrethroid exposure thus appears to cause neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity (Shafer et al., 2005), as well as adverse effects on the immune system (Rosenberg et al., 1999). Besides, many studies reveal an increased risk of cancer due to pyrethroid exposure (Ila et al., 2008, Kocaman and Topakta≈ü, 2009, Shukla et al., 2002). More specifically, some pyrethroids were classified by the US EPA as possible human carcinogens (US EPA, 2006a, US EPA, 2006b).

Minutes after last cigarette- Your heart rate returns to normal
 
6 hours after last cigarette- Your bloodstream is almost nicotine-free and carbon monoxide levels drop.  

8 hours after last cigarette- Blood oxygen levels return to normal. 

2 days after last cigarette- Lungs clear excess mucus. Senses of taste and smell improve. 

3 days after last cigarette- Your bronchial tubes relax. Breathing gets easier. Energy levels increase.


3 months after last cigarette- Decreased coughing and wheezing. Improved circulation and immune function (and even if you do get sick, it will be much easier to handle and recover from).

9 months after last cigarette- Your lungs begin to heal on a structual level!!!

5 years after last cigarette- Your risk of certain cancers, including mouth, throat, esophageal, bladder, cervical, and larynx, is reduced. 

10 years after last cigarette- Your risk of developing and dying from lung cancer is reduced. Your risk of pancreatic cancer decreases. 

15 years after last cigarette- Your risk of coronary heart disease is nearly the same as someone who has never smoked.

I was in school and a teacher randomly came in with my twin sister, and both of them were crying and asked to have a word with me in private.

POS then doubled-down and asked if she ate my dad‚Äôs dead fianc√© and I just completely lost it. 

Slammed his head on the desk, which broke his nose - and then I just silently left and cried the full walk home.

[Here's a 2 minute test](https://www.anxietycentre.com/tests/anxiety-disorder-test) you can take. It let's you know roughly where you rank in severity (if it comes back relatively low, it might be social anxiety, for example).

[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with anxiety](/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image. [More about box breathing.](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-fear-and-anxiety), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly expose yourself to situations that you know gives you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print, you can replace spider with anything, fear of driving, fear of using a phone, anything.

* [How to Overcome the Fear of Spiders](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-the-Fear-of-Spiders) (wikihow)

Overthinking:

* [Intrusive Thoughts and Overthinking: The Skill of Cognitive Defusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3vhXQy48jo) (youtube, 1.2M views)

For the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarms, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: /r/Meditation
* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

legodoom,,29 | FTM | üåàüåàüåàüåà 02.24‚ú®,"CW: multiple losses:

Well, my husband and I were HS best friends‚Äî we didn‚Äôt start dating until 6years after we graduated, and he is truly a gift from God. ü§ç‚ú® I‚Äôm the luckiest girl in the world to be married to him now for over 5 years. 

Let me start with this: my husband and I were celibate before we got married, so I want on BC when we were dating. I didn‚Äôt want children right away because I wanted to enjoy our marriage. Fast forward to  9 months married (Dec 2019) and I had to come off of my BC because of some adverse reactions. (Vision impairment, awful mood swings, non existent periods‚Äî I was worried) My first cycle post BC was strange, I was late, and had all of the classic pregnancy symptoms‚Ä¶ but I was not.

The idea of being pregnant and starting a family with this wonderful man planted a seed; I now wanted to start trying. My husband was ready the second we got married, so we started trying. Then 6 months go by and I am diagnosed with endometriosis. I‚Äôd always had it for as long as I remembered, but I thought it was normal. I was always told anytime I complained about the intense pain that ‚Äúall girls go through it, and I just needed to toughen up‚Äù. So I learned to cope.

So a year from my diagnosis I had surgery. Things went well, my surgeon was awesome, and we kept trying. But nothing. By the start of 2022 my marriage was having some growing pains, my Omi (grandmother who I was very close to) had just died of cancer and still no pregnancy‚Ä¶. Until the end of February came. We had been trying for almost 2 years, and finally we got pregnant.

We lost that baby and 2 more.(I had lost a baby two years prior to my husband and I dating)
With a total of 4 miscarriages under my belt I was losing hope. I was spiraling. My normal cheery attitude was sullen and listless. The journey was sucking the joy out of me. I wanted to give up on children, but by some miracle, on Jun 13 at 3w+3days at 5:30 in the morning I took a pregnancy test, because that‚Äôs just what I do every month‚Ä¶ this one was digital, and my period was more than 4 days away‚Äî I laid it down hating myself for even taking it ‚Äúknowing it would be negative‚Äù, when suddenly‚Äî ‚ÄúPREGNANT‚Äù flashed up on the screen.

I sobbed, terrified this could mean another miscarriage‚Ä¶ my husband heard me through his sleep crying, and came to me and I told him. He held me and told me that everything would be okay. 

And here we are. 4.5 years of trying, and 4 total pregnancy losses. This pregnancy is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced, so I‚Äôm feeling very hopeful. I think the Lord is using this experience to pursue me in a way I‚Äôve never felt so pursued. It is truly magical in every way. 

I feel blessed and lucky to just even be here. I‚Äôm 6 weeks today and I‚Äôve lost most of my babies between 6-8weeks but I‚Äôm just feeling peace. ü§ç‚ú®",0,1719824258,,,0,lb3nm8h,t3_1dsgg53,t3_1dsgg53,1719824273,5,False,February2025Bumps,t5_685jqj

Regardless of whether the vaccine is responsible for this mass (which it could be) it is something that needs to be resolved.  The good side of this issue is that tumors in kidneys are less likely to metastasize and spread all over the body‚Ä¶the prognosis is pretty good.

The studies are just coming out now with adverse side effects connected to mRNA injections.  The injections were stated by many to never leave the injection site.

headshot_g,,,"You screwed up, you wasted quite literally your best years to find a person doing absolutely none of that AND becoming overweight. For men who want serious relationships (meaning kids will be involved later) they are not looking to start with women already over 30. By the time you're together with them for a while, that theyre sure you're worth marrying and have enough capital in this economic clown world to make that happen... thats an extra 5? Something years added to the clock, sometimes longer. You'll be pushing 40.

If you added 5 years to a 20 year old it barely even registers. Even early 20s at 23 it puts them in a decent enough position to forge that family. Men you're after WONT be clubbing, WONT be on dating apps (which are cancer) they will either be at home doing their thing or outside doing their thing in meaningful hobbies/skill building endeavours. So you'll either meet them gaming or meet them actively engaging on sport/hiking/volunteering/at church etc. But they will be looking for women in an age bracket you arent in.

Your best bet imo, for a demographic that would still be in line with what you have and ""enough"" of what you want... would be chill whisky bars where working a conversation is key (females over 30, welcome to the male world where you have to have amazing verbal game or you get nowhere) or specific events related to something you're interested in (iunno, a space convention or woodworking convention or literally just SOMETHING) and just engage with people, be bright, be genuinely interested (dont fake this its so obvious). If you have literally nothing you're doing rn, find SOMETHING, ANYTHING, and start right freaking now, heck even collecting golf balls or some other odd hobby will still have men that will be acceptable to you. ""Being the table"" only works for 18 to 23 year olds and ONLY if they arent insufferable to be around.

And protip if nobodys ever told you this in your life, you're going to hear it right now. No man gives a flying fuck about your achievements, your degrees, your business, NONE of that. A man would be 100% more ok with dating a Hungry Jacks cashier that brightens his day and makes him feel amazing than a Masters degree, boss babe tech startup tycoon or anything like that. DO NOT project what women want in men to what men want in women, Im astounded by what so many women zive talked to think men are interested in and how is literally just what they look for in guys... truly it is not, we dont care if you're penniles from a 3rd world country, we only care if you improve our quality of life with your existence because we are PLENTY capable of functioning solo as thats a male default setting. Men have an extra probably 20 years on their timeline women dont have, thats just a biological fact we're born with, so us settling for a woman means she has to tick the boxes a family requires the woman to be. Does including you in that mans life improve it in any way? Is the mental cost-benefit of adding a gf to his life being outweighed by the bright energy, fun, thoughtfulness, skills, feminine energy etc. that girl can bring and is suited to? If you dont have an answer to this, this is why you cant keep a man around, work on being this and you will see results (or dont, its your life your choices, but dont blame me when guys ignore you).

Also ffs stop sleeping with your tinder dates, you're literally part of the problem. Why would men anywhere actually invest in women if women on tinder keep giving what they want from them with minimal short term effort? If every single woman on the planet KEPT THEIR LEGS SHUT until a certain standard is met, that standard would be met overnight. Ai can already hear the armies of fembots and redditards going ""but it shouldnt be on women to repress their sexuality"" or whatever else they come up with.... but it is. We dont have billions of *grapes every year from men just taking what they want when they want it from any woman in eyeshot. Women hold total control over access to p*ssy and thats just reality, so USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE as a filter.

So in short, GET SKILLS MEN CARE ABOUT which are not skills women care about in men (if you can homecook a fantastic meal from scratch you're 70% of the way there), up your verbal game because men at this stage of life will do literally anything else than have drole conversation, dont be insufferable to be around (or a feminist) and dont still be overweight as thats just a public advertisement that you lack the self-control, discipline and respect for yourself... let alone what it might mean for other people. 

All of these things are something you can achieve with purely effort and minimal to no money. Or you can do none of these things, but you know how thats turning out for you right now... so thats on you, thats your choice.",0,1719824490,,,0,lb3nxou,t3_1dslmaz,t3_1dslmaz,1719824505,-5,False,newcastle,t5_2rjoj

gnaptick,,,"Lifelong major depressive disorder (and friends) here. 

If you really want to know? Medication. When I stopped taking medication, convinced my extensive lifestyle changes would support me, the depression came back, dismantled my life, and the next time I took that medication it didn't work the same way. Drug hopping again now.

I thought I was fine, but it was just the medication doing its job. 

Everything people tell you that you need like lifestyle changes, therapy etc is true. But you also need medication, at least while you're making those changes. There were a lot of people who had something negative to say about medication while I was taking it. A lot who had some kind of magic spell that made all their depression go away. All that medication is doing more harm than good they'd say. 

The war on drugs did a number on a bunch of these psychos. 

If you are sick, and that sickness is helped by medication, you take the medication. Your immune system won't fight depression any more than it will fight cancer.

With that PSA I will tell you an unfortunate truth. Some parts of depression you can be stuck with. The memory loss is probably the worst for me, but I have other conditions contributing there so maybe it won't be for you. For the stuff that stays, you need to just accept you have to plan around it. Kind of like how now that I have mobility limitations I have to plan my house around it instead of putting everything where you would find it in a normal place.

Street_Hedgehog_9595,RomanCatholic,Roman Catholic,"Lemme ask you this. If someone came along and said I'd give you 1,000,000 dollars to avoid this sin, what would you do differently? Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God‚Äôs grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. ‚ÄúI can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.‚Äù (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. ‚ÄúAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.‚Äù (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.

I dont think anyone else out there knows what he wants to do. Im guessing here but MY guess as to why he told her is because they share many similarities as OP stated, so maybe he thought ""yeah maybeeeeee she will be okay with this too?"" In a moment of deluded weakness on his part.

Maybe even (prob not but possible) if she ups n runs away to save herself and herself only - he'll think ""wow im legit disgusting. That's it there's no hope for me."" And he will cement his fantasie and absolutely go out there and molest kids. 

The only way i can think of to help save any future victims is dragging him to therapy. And that's still only a possibility.

It‚Äôs taken me a long time to realise that life isn‚Äôt a race, and there isn‚Äôt really any things a person should‚Äôve done by any age, other than important health checks - bowel cancer screenings by I‚Äôd argue 30, mammograms, colonoscopy, Pap smears, skin cancer checks at any age if you‚Äôre getting a lot of sun exposure.

Elle m'a dit que j'exag√©rais, que c'√©tait connu que la personne faisait √ßa aux jeunes filles de la famille (y compris elle quand elle √©tait petite), et qu'il ne fallait pas voir le mal partout. 
Elle n'en a parl√© √† personne d'autre, m√™me pas mon p√®re, et a dit √† la personne qui m'a agress√©e de ne pas recommencer, ce qui n'a pas suffit. Elle m'a aussi demand√© de n'en parler √† personne, ce que j'ai fait parce que j'√©tais enfant et que je ne comprenais pas trop ce qui se passait mais que je voulais √™tre gentille. 

J'avais enfoui √ßa dans ma t√™te, j'avais pas oubli√© mais c'√©tait comme parall√®le √† ma vie, comme irr√©el, comme un r√™ve, un jour je m'en suis rappel√©e pour de vrai, √ßa a √©t√© tr√®s tr√®s dur parce que je me sentais sale et honteuse mais j'en ai parl√© √† mon p√®re, √† mon fr√®re, √† mon entourage proche. J'ai √©t√© soutenue par  mes amis. Mon p√®re et mon fr√®re ont compris la gravit√© de ce dont il s'agissait, ils m'ont √©cout√©e mais n'ont pas √©t√© tr√®s soutenant. Tr√®s peu de temps apr√®s que j'aie parl√©, la personne qui m'avait agress√©e a d√©clar√© un cancer tr√®s agressif et est morte rapidement. Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de lui reparler entre le moment o√π j'ai parl√© ""publiquement"" de ce qu'elle avait fait et sa mort. 


Je n'ai pas √©t√© √† l'enterrement et j'ai coup√© d√©finitivement les ponts avec la famille de ma m√®re. 
Mes parents ont divorc√© aussi √† ce moment-l√†, il y avait des probl√®mes depuis longtemps mais √ßa a pes√© dans la balance. 

Le sujet est revenu sur la table avec ma m√®re, elle a gard√© sa position de l'√©poque et continu√© √† d√©fendre la personne, m√™me en sachant que √ßa m'avait detruite. Elle a remis la faute sur moi en me disant que j'√©tais trop sensible. J'ai d√©cid√© √† ce moment de couper les ponts avec elle. 

√Ä cette √©poque j'ai fait une tentative de suicide, j'√©tais tr√®s affect√©e par les souvenirs qui revenaient, j'ai √©t√© disagnostiqu√©e d'un stress post traumatique assez lourd.

m0ranati0n,,,"I married the ""perfect"" person. My supposed  best friend. After almost 9 years of being together she cheated on me with a co-worker. I got in trouble at work for going to said co-worker's house and allegedly making, ""terroristic threats"" toward him. I didn't. All I did was ring his doorbell. He claimed I made threats but it's all BS. I had to leave my house because she wanted another guy over for the weekend and if I didn't leave she'd call the cops... 

**Before anyone says anything, I know the law.. i know it very well. A huge part of my job was to teach law. **

It took her a week to ""fall in love"" and get with another co-worker.  When she did and knew I knew, she decided it was best for us to separate. She moved me into a German cockroach infested apartment and locked me out of all funds. Since then, I've had the cops called on me for no reason other than to keep messing with my job. She embezzed money from our daughter's orchestra booster club (VP) made a Go Fund Me calling me an abusive husband and father to steal money from unsuspecting people. Lied about having cancer and a degree.. she moved her 3rd new BF into a house I pay for. I don't know what else will surface throughout all this but I know I am better off without her. I'd rather have roaches than to waste energy on her anymore... 

I have adjusted in less than a month. Use the serenity prayer (if you want) I like it because it helps you put things/ actions into perspective... there's nothing you could have done to prevent this. If that's who your ex partner was, they would have found a way to do it.

What helped me was being by myself and being accompanied by real friends. Let me explain lol Enjoying the things I used to do before her.  And enjoying the company I used to enjoy before her. Believe me, the world is so big that as long as you do what you love, you'll be better than just ok. You will thrive!

Even after all these bad things happening to me I'd so glad this happened because I would rather this than stay with a fake person and keep thinking I was the crazy one.

Particular507,,,"* I understand she doesn't know exactly what he's doing. But what she knows is that her mild-mannered husband is suddenly absent from their lives randomly for extended periods with vague explanations. He's acting completely out of character. She can tell he's lying, as you know she's right.
* You can't say it's unreasonable for her to be suspicious when her suspiciousness is completely justified by the fact that he IS lying to her. Whether or not she is certain of that doesn't really matter.

At that point she has no idea he cooks as stated, and everyone has right for his time alone from everybody, especially during cancer and insanely difficult situations in life, she's controlling from the beginning following and asking about every step he makes from episode 1. Controlling wife, hates her sister with mental problems, accuses Jr of doing drugs and tells him how to speak, screams on Hank when he visits because not all attention is towards her, harasses Jesse because of supposed weed her 50 year old husband with cancer is smoking(again like it's heroin) etc.

* Yea cus she wants a divorce lol. She wants a divorce and he refuses. ""I'm breaking up with you"" ""No you're not. And if you get with anyone else you're cheating."" Not sound logic

It is cheating technically since she's still married and does it by purpose to spite on him.

* The twins shot Hank because Gus forbade them from killing Walter and then told them they should kill Hank instead. Had Walter not been cooking meth, that wouldn't have happened.

Twins mistakenly thought that Walter killed Tuco which isn't the case, Gus told them the truth.

* Hank was there that day because he was using the lowjack in Jessie's car to track him. He was looking for Walt when he found Tuco. Which wouldn't have happened if Walt wasn't cooking meth.

Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly. Not to mention Hank wouldn't even be cured if Walter didn't pay treatment. But yeah what am I talking, Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

* What a hero, he saved them from a situation he put them in.

Welp he is in that situation, Hank crossed Gus a number of times and he threatened Walter that he would slaughter everyone if he tries to intervene, if he didn't, Hank would be as Jesse said, scalped same as Victor.

* Because she desperately needs it. Which she wouldn't, if Walt just took the job at Gray Matter.

So she needs that sweet sweet money she said she hates just a few days ago after telling Walter that if he goes she won't call police when he left? Her problem, make up your mind duh. Walter choose which job he will take and what he'll do with his life, it's his problem not hers if she doesn't care, but she does because MONEY!

* Walt literally poisons a child with lily of the valley to manipulate Jesse into helping him. Gus is a villain, so is Walt.

Again, same as the previous thing with killing Gus, it was lily of the valley(no deaths were confirmed from it) and not cyanide or ricin first and foremost, not cheering on it of course, but it was again to kill Gus and prevent the above mentioned stuff about Gus and his entire family from happening.

(mind you, I wasn't a kid to cry from pain much. I didn't cry when I broke several bones after an accident or any other times i can remember.)

We went into the specialist a day later, and they explained it would take an hour or two and I wouldn't feel any pain, just pressure. I had gotten biopsies near the area before, so I wasn't afraid of the idea of pressure. I hadn't found it painful previously. After they give me the medications via IV, localized injections, and some numbing agent that was in the form of something similar to a cream, they began the procedure.

Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren‚Äôt just a moral good because they prevent disease; they‚Äôre a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they‚Äôre essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

   **Source**: Pinker, S. (2011). *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. Viking.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we‚Äôre talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation‚Äîtraits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate‚Äôs last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren‚Äôt just about reducing cancer rates‚Äîthey‚Äôre about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let‚Äôs face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it‚Äôs right to recycle or how to create a more just society. After all, moral truths hiding in plain sight are just waiting for a good peer-reviewed journal to bring them to light.",0,1719802089,,,0,lb2mmwd,t3_1dseqza,t1_lb2la3k,1719802104,3,False,GenZ,t5_2tz25

Nijos,,,"> At that point she has no idea he cooks as stated, and everyone has right for his time alone from everybody, especially during cancer and insanely difficult situations in life, she's controlling from the beginning following and asking about every step he makes from episode 1.

He is acting out of character and being suspicious.  That's because he's committing crimes and attempting to conceal it.  She knows that because she knows him.  Someday when you have a serious relationship you'll understand.  He isn't just trying to have alone time, he's committing crimes.  

> Controlling wife, hates her sister with mental problems

Not controlling, just doesn't like being lied to.  Doesn't hate her sister, just doesn't like being gifted stolen property.  Would you be okay with that? 

> accuses Jr of doing drugs and tells him how to speak

Nope, Marie thinks Jr is doing drugs.  

> It is cheating technically since she's still married and does it by purpose to spite on him.

If you want to break up with someone and they stop you from breaking up with them you can do whatever you want.  This is a genuinely retarded point.  

> Twins mistakenly thought that Walter killed Tuco which isn't the case, Gus told them the truth.

They wouldn't have been trying to kill Hank if Walter didn't cook meth, end of story. 

> Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly.

Hank wouldn't have run into Tuco alone in the middle of the desert if he wasn't looking for Walter.  This is also a retarded, moot point.  He never would have been in that situation without Walter cooking meth.  

> Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

Hank wouldn't have been in the desert with Tuco without Walter's actions.  I'm objectively correct, it's his fault.

> Walter choose which job he will take and what he'll do with his life, it's his problem not hers if she doesn't care

He is actively involving his family in his crimes.  Maybe if you have a family someday you'll understand.  

> Again, same as the previous thing with killing Gus, it was lily of the valley(no deaths were confirmed from it) and not cyanide or ricin first and foremost, not cheering on it of course, but it was again to kill Gus and prevent the above mentioned stuff about Gus and his entire family from happening. 

Know what would have prevented the whole situation?  Taking the job at Gray Matter and not being a degenerate criminal.  

>  Gus is only villain there, Walter had to make immoral decision.

Walter poisoned a child lol.  That's categorically villainous.  He didn't HAVE to do anything, he WANTED to be a criminal.  He had other choices he could have made that would have prevented everything.  

> Then don't go around and police which fictional character can be hated or love, that's the thing that is extremely stupid here.

I'm not policing anything, I'm disagreeing with you.  

> They're all grown adults and can make decisions they like and she had a number of chances at the very beginning as soon as she found out. 

Yea she should have gone to the cops immediately.  Not a good choice by her.  Literally nothing compared to what Walt does, not even close.  

> And again parroting and taking Mike's speech for literal about how every single bad thing in New Mexico and Mexico happened because of Walter who masterminded years of events to make everything bad because without him it's heaven, everyone's happy and nothing ever bad happened and wouldn't happen without him or his bad ego which was his main motivation in starting the WW3.

Private hospital I‚Äôm assuming? If not, kudos to Kenya! 

But yeah, that would also be your experience in a good private hospital in Mexico. We do have great doctors and great facilities, my uncle had prostate cancer and his surgeon performed a robot assisted prostectomy and his recovery was great. Hospital was great, it was like staying in a hotel. 

I had surgery in a public hospital and I‚Äôd need to write another huge wall of text to explain how different the experience was. The quality of care is good, as good as a private maybe, but if you work in healthcare you know that depends on the team more than the facilities. 

>>I need these medications, but is me buying that medication elsewhere resulting in someone who actually lives in that country and pays taxes to not receive that medication?

Nope, don‚Äôt even worry about that. There are general shortages like when COVID hit and everyone and their mother was buying any and all medications that would supposedly help prevent it which was a problem because we have a lot of medication available over the counter. I remember specifically something that was used to treat lupus, can‚Äôt remember the name of the medication but the point is, healthy people with means were getting it and some lupus patients had a hard time finding it. 

I had trouble finding what was originally prescribed to be as treatment for latent TB, public hospitals didn‚Äôt have it, private pharmacy either so I ended up having to restart treatment. 

But the way things work is by government contracts, the problem arises when there‚Äôs not enough money in the budget, the government just being bad at managing things, corruption or meds that go ‚Äúmissing‚Äù.

So no, don‚Äôt feel guilty for buying cheaper meds here because those go by supply and demand and that‚Äôs just capitalism.

I suggest havingnsome sort of spiritual practice where you can stay grounded as much as possible. Love yourself especially in those moments where you feel that things are out of control.

Ace_Arriande,,,"I think part of the early story dragged on a bit, but overall, I really enjoyed it. The *only* thing I had any real problem with narrative wise was Zoraal Ja's motivation. I still... don't really know why he did what he did, why he was so full of hatred, why he was willing to kill his own family (just to prove he's different from his father?), etc. That being said, I'm easy to please, so I still liked the role he served in the story even if I felt his motivation was lacking.

I was *really* looking forward to kicking Bakool Ja Ja's ass... but, of course, they pulled the whole tragic backstory thing and made me want to give him a hug instead. The scene with the train was also pretty fun and the second attempt at invasion left me hyped as fuck when the dragons appeared to help out.

Between Haurchefant and now Otis, I'm more tempted to pick up PLD than ever, but I'll resist since I don't like tanking. Otis was seriously amazing, though. I loved him. Sphene was also adorable and I was foolishly hoping she would survive until FFXIV releases romance and dating feature, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. At least we still have G'raha who is superior in every way regardless in that area. Also, they knew what they were doing when they gave us a gondola ride with G'raha in the part of the city known for its romance.

The final zone was beautiful and full of tragedy, and while I do hope there's a way to switch back to its previous aesthetic later, I won't complain about how it looks post-story. It still looks pretty nice.

Overall, the story was perfectly fine to me and there were no points of it that I did not enjoy even if some of the earlier segments felt long. Aside from Zoraal Ja's motivation, the only other thing I had an issue with (which is entirely a me thing and not the game's fault) is how it treats the pursuit of immortality. Maybe this is just my transhumanist side showing, but I think it's annoying when games (typically Japanese games) treat the pursuit of immortality like it's some wrong thing because it's ""natural"" for everything to die. Many things are natural. Getting the cold is natural. Breaking a bone is natural. Getting cancer is natural. Just because something is ""natural"" and has always been this way does not mean that we shouldn't strive to fix it.

We 100% committed genocide there in the final zone, and I'm entirely on Sphene's side when it comes to viewing the Endless' lives as equally legitimate to the lives of the ""living."" Her way of resolving things was an issue, but had she been more conservative with power while also seeking help, then maybe things could have turned out differently. I wish there was a way we could have protected the Endless and investigated a new way of sustaining that technology, but alas. I won't take points off from the story just because I philosophically disagree with it, though. The story they set out to tell with the message they wanted to express was still told in a satisfactory manner even if I disagree.

Oh, and on Wuk Lamat since apparently she's the biggest point of contention, personally, I loved her. Yes, we served as a sort of sidekick to her this time... but so what? Now, in most other MMOs, I would agree I hate that feeling of just being ""the sidekick."" My biggest issues with WoW and GW2 narratively were that the players were just glorified sidekicks and errand runners. We weren't really respected for anything we did and everyone else got to take credit for everything. But in FFXIV, it's the exact opposite. Basically the entire half of the other world already massively simps for us and thinks we're the best damn thing to ever live, and most things are directly attributed to us. Here, we've stepped foot into the other half of the world that has no idea who we were while signing up to basically be someone else's bodyguard. It's okay to be a bit on the sideline this time. Personally, I would expect our WoL to enjoy it and have fun not being the center of attention for once. Bro just wants to go on an adventure and got to.

LizzieMac123,,,"Insurance is not like going to a buffet- you can't just walk into a doctor's office, say you want a bunch of tests, just in case, and expect insurance to pay for it. 

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time. Same with a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) or your state's equivalent- you can't join mid-year without a QLE--- and open enrollment doesn't start until November for a January 1 effective date.",0,1719804535,,,0,lb2ry7s,t3_1dsiiy6,t3_1dsiiy6,1719804551,6,False,HealthInsurance,t5_2qnt0

I'm trying to figure out what I can do for my mom in the not-so-distant future. I also worry about my brother and sister's families.

Dockers-Man,,,"Oh, I remember those people at school who were so desperate to be liked by everyone, and there was nothing authentic about them. They seem to have become even more desperate as adults (I'm drawing a long bow with using that word to describe them) who have spent every opportunity trying to re-create the same pathetic image that they wanted to portray at school. But when you scratch beneath the surface a little, the veneer of 'amazing' wears off very quickly.

As for my school experiences, I made friends that were authentic, and 40 years late they are still my friends. The rest of them were people that I was forced to deal with, and at 17 had the opportunity to take my own direction. Joining sporting groups and other groups that I have a shared interest in are much more valuable, and my involvement is based on common ground that generally doesn't involve politics when you're able to communicate as adults.

These social outlets are different to the workplace, where we're bound to be confronted with insufferable assholes that aren't looking for common ground, and take it upon themselves to try and create their own fiefdom. If we're lucky, we find a workplace that is largely free of this shit, but these environmental are subject to change, and I'm sure that most people have had work environments that were once a lot of fun, but then became cancerous due to the introduction of people (largely management and self-proclaimed influencers) that turned the culture into something ugly.

Doctors were stumped. My father didn‚Äôt believe me and thought I was faking my symptoms. 

I dealt with the symptoms until I was 26, when I went to the hospital for the 3rd time in less than a week, because I thought I was both having a heart attack and a brain aneurysm at the same time. I was about 110 pounds when wet. While they tried to diagnose me, I actually started to have a heart attack, since my heart rate was 180-200. I was put into a medical coma, they saved my life by causing a pseudo aneurysm in my leg, and putting a ballon pump in my heart. 

I was in that coma for 3 months. They finally found out what was really causing my issues. Cancer! Well two kinds, actually. I had cancerous cells on my thyroid gland, but it was not the only cause, I also had something called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. It caused a tumor, called a pheochromocytoma, to grow on my adrenal gland, and that was the underlying problem. 

Long story short, I was very lucky and had an amazing team of endocrinologists at UCSF. They removed my thyroid, some lymph nodes, and the phyo, and took that adrenal gland with it.

NoRoyal2270,,,"I have to admit, that‚Äôs the best point I‚Äôve seen anybody make on it. And I will concede that for the most part your correct. Government has become too large and too pervasive within our society. As well as nobody should come between you and your doctor. 

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‚Äòshould‚Äô be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn‚Äôt a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don‚Äôt believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don‚Äôt know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I‚Äôll restate that you‚Äôre correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can‚Äôt chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don‚Äôt do those sorts of  things.

It's sometimes in the small details.  Driving from northern New Hampshire back to South Dakota and just noticing how oddly expensive supplies are along the way.  ""How did I just pay $15 for an energy drink and one of those little travel-sized packets of antacids that have like 1-2 doses in them?  Really?  $15?  That seems like a lot even at a rest stop.  How did buying one meal at Wendy's and splitting it just cost me $20?  Why isn't anything in the motel room working properly?""  Those are the boring details.

The more interesting small details that just feel a little ""off"", like the old world was traded out for a new and slightly shittier model while we were all knocked unconscious are things like, ""why does this small town in Pennsylvania look totally abandoned?  None of the houses have lights on.  Somehow it's darker than rural South Dakota out here.  There's no signs of life anywhere... oh shit, this town lost about half its population after 2020.  We're basically driving through a ghost town.""  It's meeting up with my business partner who just spent the week in New York City instead of driving across the country like I did and hearing about how all of his normally successful friends can't find work-- and neither could he.  How he saw one of my close friends that I met while working on TV and film in the Before Times, and how she couldn't find a job either-- the film sets are closed.  It's the moment when he showed her pictures of ""Out of Lockstep"" and she teared up-- even though it was pictures of the funny part and she was very pro-mandate in 2021.  The really strange details are things like hearing from my dad about how he tracks the crime rates in Rochester NY like they're the weather report now-- he needs to know how bad it is before deciding to go out for the day.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

It's moments like the unvaxxed gathering at PorcFest, where EVERYONE had stories about losing jobs, friends, and family members.  Family members that weren't lost to the political division were lost to ""sudden"" deaths and aggressive cancers.  On the car ride out to the Northeast, I texted some friends in NYC while my travel buddy was taking the wheel.  On the way back, I heard from one of those friends that her mom has cancer now.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.  I channeled years of anger, grief, and dark humor into an art installation that fills multiple rooms.  There was enough of those feelings to keep growing it larger and adding more.  I don't know if I'll \*ever\* find closure by doing this project, but at least I'm doing way better than I would be without it.

I saw a commenter in another thread laughing about how he saw someone saying they expect Dutton to win the next election. If they stepped out of your internet hive-minded group think and have a look at the current polls as we're heading towards the next election, they'd see that there's basically nothing between Albo and Dutton for who's gonna win the next election. Don't forget that Shorten was a sure thing to win the 2019 election with even Mainstream news media all but accepting an LNP defeat, but still somehow lost to Morrison. 

The LNP holds the biggest voter base in our country and the only way they lose is through preferential voting. In 2022, The LNP still won the popular vote in pretty much every state and Territory despite Morrison's severe unpopularity at that point. They still only lost due to Labor having enough no. 1 preferences which they simply won't have nearly as many come 2025, and other people preferencing Labor higher than the LNP, which again Labor won't get nearly as many. 

Dutton also has pretty much all the media on his side, plus any media that's pro Greens because they're also against Labor which only helps Dutton and the LNP. So he's getting little if not zero push back on his insanely idiotic Nuclear Energy scheme, in fact you had ""journalists"" telling Albo he should be praising Dutton for his Nuclear policy after questioning why Albo and the Labor party are against it. That's the state of journalism in our country. It's all batting for one side and nothing is stopping them from doing so. 

Labor could cure all known cancer and the media would call them out on why people are still breaking their bones or getting the flu. Meanwhile the LNP could start mass murdering everyone and the media would praise them for helping with overpopulation. 

I'm worried that Dutton will win the next election through no fault of the Albanese Labor Government, but through pure media manipulation. Dutton has brought nothing good to the table and the only thing he's being hard on is his Nuclear Policy. Even if you're for that his Nuclear Policy, do you really want Dutton and the LNP to be at the forefront of Nuclear Power in this country? I'd say no, you wouldn't be for that at all. 

Remember to preference Liberals and the LNP last, as well as their sister parties like One Nation and UAP. They aren't for you, they're for their donors and shareholders. That's it.

Overchimp,,,"Evolutionary biology is just a study of what we are. You think it‚Äôs disgusting to understand ourselves as biological organisms? I‚Äôm reminded of a quote from Nietzsche:¬†

>¬†Science offends the modesty of all real women.¬†With it they feel as if someone wanted to peek under their skin - or even worse, under their dress and finery.

Anyway,

>¬†Though It‚Äôd be very strange for a 25 yo with that amount of compassion and patience to not find a similar aged and willing partner

Let‚Äôs say less than 1% of people in this world can be your soul mate. Maybe less than 0.01% even. The odds of someone having the right qualities for you AND being your age isn‚Äôt very high. Whereas if you include all ages, there are more options. If I fell in love with a girl who is 25, then imagine a parallel universe where she was 20 instead. Wouldn‚Äôt I still fall in love with her? Would a few years of‚Ä¶ ‚Äúexperience‚Äù make much of a difference? Either the potential is there or it isn‚Äôt. Now if you‚Äôre horrible at judging people, then I can imagine that you might struggle with this sort of appraisal process. But I‚Äôm very intuitive (cancer), so it comes naturally for me. And this doesn‚Äôt even factor in the unconscious motives for a younger girl (on average, fewer sexual partners, which means less emotional baggage, and less chance of any ongoing communications with the exes). And there‚Äôs also more time to test out the relationship before deciding to have kids (if you want to have, say, 4 kids, but start at 27 or so, then the risk of disorders will increase with the mother‚Äôs age‚Ä¶)

It really just comes down to the fact that if a man sees a special girl, he doesn‚Äôt want to miss that chance.¬†",0,1719807242,,,0,lb2xdnl,t3_1dsdu8l,t1_lb2vg23,1719807257,1,False,ask,t5_2qhlj

So what? How‚Äôs that relevant? When someone tells you he has mental health problems, cancer, symptoms of a heart attack or whatever, your response isn‚Äôt ‚Äúoh, but maybe that‚Äôs not true, why should I believe you, nah‚Äù

While the concept of ‚Äúreasonable accommodations‚Äù is fuzzy, anything that requires another person to submit to violation of their boundaries is by definition unreasonable.¬†

The way I was raised, we watch out and help the people around us. Especially friends and friends of friends but even strangers. 

When an old lady falls down on the street I help her up and call an ambulance if needed, I don‚Äôt tell her she may be faking it to steal my wallet and that she doesn‚Äôt have a right for help anyway. 

And if someone in our group gets sick and asks to be taken to a hospital I don‚Äôt tell him to take care of his own shit because he‚Äôs responsible for himself and doesn‚Äôt have a right to be taken to a hospital and that there‚Äôs a risk of him faking it for whatever malicious motive I can construct. 

And when my friend tells me his anxiety disorder doesn‚Äôt allow him to do this or that then we will happily find other activities rather then telling him that he‚Äôs just faking it to have it his way and that we don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúsubmit to violation of our boundaries‚Äù.

Once I make myself part of a group, whether that‚Äôs just a trip with friends and friends of friends or our society as a whole, I accept a moral and ethical responsibility for the people around me (and I‚Äôm glad that my home country actually makes it a legal responsibility to help). Otherwise I simply shouldn‚Äôt be there in the first place.

And should I ever be in a situation where I need the help or support or compassion of those around me,  I hope they‚Äôll grant me the same treatment.

PatientNobody9503,,,"Thank you for your insight. I am an introvert, but I can be an extrovert too at times if I'm comfortable enough in a situation. I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

The only reason I want to find other converts is because they have seen a lot of what I have seen likely growing up in the Western world and not being born muslim.

When I was on biologics I only used muscle relaxers and pain meds on days I work, although I occasionally maybe need a muscle relaxer on days off where I was doing a lot of activity.  I could fall asleep easier and wake up and just go.

I am currently fighting my new insurance to cover my biologic and it's a struggle.  There are some days I get off work, and even with the pills I've taken I'm at a 8-9 on the pain scale....and I'm using my cane more often and saving up to get a rollator just in case this battle goes on much longer.

I understand the risks, and every 6 months I get a TB test and my blood tested for things like WBC.  I wear a mask when I am in public and make sure to sanitize my hands often just to cut back on potential issues. 

This is a very personal thing but the risks of biologics do not worry me as I accepted my fate of getting cancer (really bad family history...and I do mean really bad) when I was like 11.

This post's original body text:  

I have been living in my Lola‚Äôs house since I was 5 years old. She took care of me since yung parents ko nasa City kami nasa probinsiya. 

Lahat ng anak niya except kay papa naiwan dito sa bahay para may kasama siya. Bills are divided here. Electricity kanya while sa akin ang water and groceries weekly. My rent for space siya na sina papa ang nag mamanage. Though pinapangalan niya kay papa ang Business Permit sa kanya parin ang bayad ng renta. Si mama may maliit na carenderia.

Recently nagkasakit siya. Doctor said may bukol siya sa tyan which can lead to cancer daw. Di na pwede biopsy due to her age and maintenance na lang na gamot. 

She was suppose to go to Singapore kasama yung isang 2 na kapatid ni papa for vacation. Pero dahil nag kasakit siya at na confine ng matagal sa hospital na cancel. Yung mga kapatid ni papa nagalit because all has been paid na daw.

I know this post is turning into a rant but para lang clear ang picture. Hospital from our probinsiya is 1 hour away. The 2 siblings ayaw mag bantay. Ang isa US nurse that doesn‚Äôt like the hospital because ‚Äúits pangit daw‚Äù not like sa ‚ÄúYu esss‚Äù. Yung isa was busy partying and drinking because dumating yung college best friend niya from abroad.

Ang nag bantay kay lola is yung tita ko na asawa ng isa pang kapatid ni papa (hindi yung 2 na pupunta sana sa SG) since siya lang ang available. Di pwede sina mama at papa kasi may baby na ako and baka may madala silang sakit but everyday they drive papunta sa hospital. Mag dadala ng pagkain or kung ano kailangan. 

Nung nalabas na si lola sa hospital they decided without our knowledge na ilipat si lola doon sa bahay ng tita ko na nag bantay. Because ang sabi nung isa na ‚ÄúUS NARS‚Äù napabayaan daw namin si lola. Agree naman yung lasingero. 

US nars spent most of her time here sa PH na nililibre friends niya from Highschool instead of spending time with my lola. Even used lola to pay for her hotels and expenses. The lasingero only visits to ask money.

Pasensya po if sobrang haba na.

Tanong ko po is if mawawala na po si lola and they decide to sell her house pero di pumayag si papa can they still sell it? Ang tittle is I believe naka pangalan pa sa mother in law ng lola ko. 

May bahay naman po kami pero naiwan kami kay lola para may kasama siya since ang totoo sila ang naging pabaya. Ayaw nila na ibalik si lola dito sa bahay.

If they sell the house wala naman kami magagawa. Akin lang yung memories na dito ako lumaki kasama si lola.

Like he‚Äôs a miracle baby from an already special individual, a two headed Mamool Ja. At least from the trial it seems that there were a lot of expectations placed on him as miracle baby (similar to Bakool Ja Ja tbh).¬†

So because he‚Äôs expected to be so great and amazing his identity, and legacy, needs to be just as if not better than his father‚Äôs. And like part of that is, beating his father in combat and ruling over Tulliyolal.

But wait, now he‚Äôs got two new siblings and they don‚Äôt have the burden of all these expectations heaped on them. And it seems they even have an actual relationship with Gulool Ja Ja. Like for example at some point Wuk says when they‚Äôve eaten together as family her and Koana usually talked with their similar interest parent head and Bakool Ja Ja only spoke when spoken to.

So his resentment for his family makes sense tbh. But  I really couldn‚Äôt get how he got to the ‚ÄúToo much peace has made everyone weak, we need wars for a proper reality check.‚Äù point that needle was not threaded correctly in the story so who knows how he got there lol

Also, like it‚Äôs not just Japanese games/media push ‚Äúsearching for immortality is bad‚Äù though. Most media treats it as a bad thing because 9/10 the solution ¬†to make it happen is bad, like turning soul‚Äôs into 1UPs or using that to sustain ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù filled with memories.¬†

But also like breaking bones and getting cancer arnt natural in the way death is natural. Neither of those things are 100% guaranteed to happen to everyone. However death is and that‚Äôs why in-game (and in most media) a search for immortality is goes against the natural order. And probably why most media also makes the price for immortality fairly high like for example with Sphene needing to harvest the entire star to maintain the Endless.

Or even to add onto that, the living people in S9 at the end of the day might as well have been livestock. Well treated sure but they needed living people to help maintain the status quo. Especially since Sphene didn‚Äôt want to just murder harvest from the get go.

allemm,,,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal.

I think you guys are heading down a rough road. I know people married to an ‚Äúunrealistic dreamer‚Äù and it can go several ways but what I typically see play out are variations of two scenarios:

1. (The good) The unrealistic dreamer accepts that their dream is more of a hobby. They do it in their *spare* time. Maybe their spouse makes enough so they can make it a ‚Äúfull time‚Äù hobby. But the goal is mostly personal enrichment and any money they make is seen as a bonus. The unrealistic dreamer is very present in the family and still contributing, albeit financially or with time/labour. 

2. (The bad) The unrealistic dreamer chases failed dream after failed dream. They drain the family‚Äôs financial resources into their doomed endeavors. They are usually absent from family life as they waste countless hours on their latest thing. Each failure compounds the pressure and the desperation for success. They are a massive drain on their family and basically everyone resents each other.

MethodMaven,,,"I‚Äôm taking your questions in reverse order ‚Ä¶

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don‚Äôt think your dad has to worry about that ü§£.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‚Äòwhat works best for you‚Äô answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don‚Äôt have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‚Äògrow the pouch‚Äô.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad‚Äôs generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?

The reason trump cosplays as a patriot is because he is feeding on the U.S. middle class, not because he is one of us.

The GOP fell in line to MAGA because Trump did what pathological liars do, he told them anything they wanted to hear.  

Trump with his money laundering and child raping buddy Epstein, Roger Stone with his kompromat sex clubs in DC and Nevada, and Paul Manafort with his election rigging pretty much everywhere, sat down at a table with Mike Johnson and the extreme religious right and convinced them that they were the same. 

They self evidently are not, at least at a surface level, but there is enough common ground in the exploitation of children and desire for unilateral control (project 2025) that they became the worlds weirdest and most dysfunctional orgy.  The religious right is naive enough to believe trump at his word so they have made him their defacto savior. 

Trump belongs to the authoritarians.  The GOP now belongs to trump. But their overall goal is the same-

Kleptocracy.

The religious right is naive enough to believe trump at his word so they have made him their defacto savior. 

Trump belongs to the authoritarians.  The GOP now belongs to trump. But their overall goal is the same-

Kleptocracy. 

Putin, Xi and MBS all aligned together last year to attempt the BRICS overthrow of the USD.  It failed but it didn‚Äôt stop Xi‚Äôs push on Taiwan or MBS‚Äôs part in the plan. 


Stay frosty. Eyes up.  It‚Äôs the only way we don‚Äôt all end up kissing the ring of a dictator.

2.)A Star Is Born (w/ lady gaga):      seriously DEVASTATING -üò≠Hopeful young female artist is luckily discovered by a huge rockstar, and he helps bring her to fame while struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. I‚Äôm super impressed with her acting, Bradley Cooper is always 100%, and without bias, thematically and contextually, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. 

3.) The Pianist (2002 w/ Adrian Brody):       Very arguably my most favorite movie of -ALL- TIME‚Ä¶ especially as a pianist, myself. Biographically-reenacted TRUE story of famous Jewish Pianist, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, and his detailed life before, during, and after the Holocaust.

(I‚Äôm an austrian and jewishüòÖüíÄ) This is devastation after devastation that has my jaw dropped the entire movie. Seriously - this movie is a MUST SEE. (FUN FACT: the entire soundtrack is *only, Chopin piano solos)

*BONUS DEVASTATING MOVIE*

4.) These Were Soldiers (2002 w/ Mel Gibson):       Prepare yourself before this one. This is another film that fights into my top 3, as I‚Äôd argue it is the most *realistic* portrayal of the devastation of the REALITY, of war. From training, to having the reality sink in that many of them would not come back, to being on the battlefield, to the family back at home; this is another real, biographically-represented film about a famous battle (massacre) in Vietnam on American troops. The Battle of the Drang. This one hurts - through and through.
 (FUN FACT: There‚Äôs only 1 single soundtrack to this entire film. None else is needed. It is ‚ÄòMansions of the Lord‚Äô sang by the West Point Glee Club. 
FUN FACT 2: My father went to West Point, then into the Rangers and left as an Airborne Ranger/LTC-P. in 86. When he was stationed in Germany in the 70s-80s, Mel Gibson‚Äôs Character, West Point Graduate Hal Moore, was my father‚Äôs Commander. Surreal.)

Ok-Consequence203,,,"Ty so much for your detailed replies and for explaining everything. I definitely felt a little blindsided by the ANA test. I went to my orthopedist for hand numbness/tingling in both hands (it has since resolved) and some finger stiffness. No swelling or redness ever but I was scared it could be RA or early RA. X-ray clear but I know it could be too early to see anything. I asked him to send me for the RA blood panel and he included the ANA. I felt totally blindsided by the results because I wasn‚Äôt even thinking it could be another autoimmune condition besides RA. Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn‚Äôt limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

AvijeWitchyWoman,,Former Employee,"Cancer can be considered a disability under the ADA because it can cause changes that affect physical and mental wellness, both during and after treatment. These changes can include physical disabilities from surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, as well as ongoing health challenges like infertility, nerve damage, heart problems, and dental and vision issues. The psychological trauma associated with a cancer diagnosis can also persist long after treatment",0,1719811279,,,0,lb34lxn,t3_1dqc4pt,t1_lb25nqz,1719811295,1,False,Wawa,t5_2s7yi

lizard-fondue-6887,,,"Average walking speed is like 3 to 3.5 miles an hour.  That works out to 17:00 to 20:00 minutes a mile.  12:00 minutes a mile is a little bit faster than that.  

That said, running is really defined as the physical action of feet leaving the ground rather.  Walking keeps the feet on the ground.

Plus people can have physical limitations as well and they are still allowed to run, be social, and enjoy it.  My sister was a 2x Boston finisher at about 3:30 when she was in her late 30s.  However, she had cancer in her early 40s and it destroyed her ability to run fast.  She still does half marathons because it makes her happy, but now its a 13 to 14 minute mile pace.

risqueboudoirbysk,,,"oto what I understand from whatever you have expressed here is that your mother is definitely trying her best to manage the family after her divorce. We do not know the reason behind the same. Keeping that aside I am sure it would have been super hard on her to learn her kid has cancer and she definitely must have gone through hell till you have recovered. 

Understand she is trying to vent her emotions I am sure it can be hurting and traumatic when we can't help in the situation. My advice if you can pick a job, do it preferably in a different city. You can keep trying for your UPSC while you are working. Many do it and you will as well if you are determined enough.

Professor_Eindackel,,,"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don‚Äôt seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it‚Äôs hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me. I would do it again.",0,1719811622,,,0,lb356j4,t3_1br5i5y,t1_lb317aj,1719811638,3,False,ProstateCancer,t5_2s1qy
