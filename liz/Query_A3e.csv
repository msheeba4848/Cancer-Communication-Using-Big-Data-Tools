Particular507,,,"* I understand she doesn't know exactly what he's doing. But what she knows is that her mild-mannered husband is suddenly absent from their lives randomly for extended periods with vague explanations. He's acting completely out of character. She can tell he's lying, as you know she's right.
* You can't say it's unreasonable for her to be suspicious when her suspiciousness is completely justified by the fact that he IS lying to her. Whether or not she is certain of that doesn't really matter.

At that point she has no idea he cooks as stated, and everyone has right for his time alone from everybody, especially during cancer and insanely difficult situations in life, she's controlling from the beginning following and asking about every step he makes from episode 1. Controlling wife, hates her sister with mental problems, accuses Jr of doing drugs and tells him how to speak, screams on Hank when he visits because not all attention is towards her, harasses Jesse because of supposed weed her 50 year old husband with cancer is smoking(again like it's heroin) etc.

* Yea cus she wants a divorce lol. She wants a divorce and he refuses. ""I'm breaking up with you"" ""No you're not. And if you get with anyone else you're cheating."" Not sound logic

It is cheating technically since she's still married and does it by purpose to spite on him.

* The twins shot Hank because Gus forbade them from killing Walter and then told them they should kill Hank instead. Had Walter not been cooking meth, that wouldn't have happened.

Twins mistakenly thought that Walter killed Tuco which isn't the case, Gus told them the truth.

* Hank was there that day because he was using the lowjack in Jessie's car to track him. He was looking for Walt when he found Tuco. Which wouldn't have happened if Walt wasn't cooking meth.

Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly. Not to mention Hank wouldn't even be cured if Walter didn't pay treatment. But yeah what am I talking, Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

* What a hero, he saved them from a situation he put them in.

Welp he is in that situation, Hank crossed Gus a number of times and he threatened Walter that he would slaughter everyone if he tries to intervene, if he didn't, Hank would be as Jesse said, scalped same as Victor.

* Because she desperately needs it. Which she wouldn't, if Walt just took the job at Gray Matter.

So she needs that sweet sweet money she said she hates just a few days ago after telling Walter that if he goes she won't call police when he left? Her problem, make up your mind duh. Walter choose which job he will take and what he'll do with his life, it's his problem not hers if she doesn't care, but she does because MONEY!

* Walt literally poisons a child with lily of the valley to manipulate Jesse into helping him. Gus is a villain, so is Walt.

Again, same as the previous thing with killing Gus, it was lily of the valley(no deaths were confirmed from it) and not cyanide or ricin first and foremost, not cheering on it of course, but it was again to kill Gus and prevent the above mentioned stuff about Gus and his entire family from happening.

Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren’t just a moral good because they prevent disease; they’re a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they’re essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

   **Source**: Pinker, S. (2011). *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. Viking.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we’re talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation—traits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate’s last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren’t just about reducing cancer rates—they’re about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let’s face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it’s right to recycle or how to create a more just society. After all, moral truths hiding in plain sight are just waiting for a good peer-reviewed journal to bring them to light.",0,1719802089,,,0,lb2mmwd,t3_1dseqza,t1_lb2la3k,1719802104,3,False,GenZ,t5_2tz25

He is acting out of character and being suspicious.  That's because he's committing crimes and attempting to conceal it.  She knows that because she knows him.  Someday when you have a serious relationship you'll understand.  He isn't just trying to have alone time, he's committing crimes.  

> Controlling wife, hates her sister with mental problems

Not controlling, just doesn't like being lied to.  Doesn't hate her sister, just doesn't like being gifted stolen property.  Would you be okay with that? 

> accuses Jr of doing drugs and tells him how to speak

Nope, Marie thinks Jr is doing drugs.  

> It is cheating technically since she's still married and does it by purpose to spite on him.

If you want to break up with someone and they stop you from breaking up with them you can do whatever you want.  This is a genuinely retarded point.

They wouldn't have been trying to kill Hank if Walter didn't cook meth, end of story. 

> Hank was already actively hunting Tuco before it, same thing would happen since he was closing in on him except with the difference that Hank would probably be dead since Tuco wouldn't be wounded by Jesse in that situation and could shoot properly.

Hank wouldn't have run into Tuco alone in the middle of the desert if he wasn't looking for Walter.  This is also a retarded, moot point.  He never would have been in that situation without Walter cooking meth.  

> Walter personally hired the Twins to shoot Hank multiple times and then cured him just so he could continue to mess with him because he hates his guts amirite?

Hank wouldn't have been in the desert with Tuco without Walter's actions.  I'm objectively correct, it's his fault.

Walter poisoned a child lol.  That's categorically villainous.  He didn't HAVE to do anything, he WANTED to be a criminal.  He had other choices he could have made that would have prevented everything.

pnam0204,,,"**THE ETERNAL HERO AND THE FINALITY**

“What nonsense are you spewing? A destructor don’t solve problems, I end both the troublemakers and the victims equally.”

The feminine boy in highschool girl uniform look up from his phone, he’s clearly annoyed at the intruder and their accusation. Part of him was also surprise that someone suddenly found him. But a quick glance at the soul and he already realize she’s an acquantaince. Much like himself, the Reincarnated Hero is also a constant variable throughout countless worlds. However, to retain past life’s memory and recognize him like this is still the first time occurence.

“I’ve seen through your facade. You’re not a heartless destroyer as you always claimed to be.”

Yurika the Infinite Reincarnator claim, this might be the first time she meet this boy in front of her in this life, but she had also met and fought side-by-side or clashed blade with countless other versions of him during her infinite lives

“You save helpless victims while saying you’ll end then when their ‘expiry date’ actually come. You slain corrupted gods because they reach ‘expiry date’. You cure cancer while calling it ‘killing the errors’. Yet your goodwills never extend to humanity as a whole. You can slay eldritch horrors from another dimensions yet refuse to lift a finger when wars break out”

“And why should I? Great power great responsibilities? Ridiculous! Just the excuses greedy humanity uses to exploit the goodwill of those with power. You think you ants can exploit me the same way?”

“I simply can’t understand you. After unlocking memories of all my previous lives, I recognize you in every of them. You have the power, you have the goodwills, yet you always chose to be a bystander even when humanity of that world was dying.”

Yurika has deduced from experience and past lives’ memories that the boy in front of her is not a regular mortal. He’s some kind of divine beings that’s also different than the gods she had seen. Not bound by worship, humanity or even the world. His Authority exceeds even that of whatever Chief God of any world despite being a foreign entity in their home turf. Yet he standby idly whenever apocalyptic events happened. And instead of helping the remaining human rebuild, he simply end the world itself.

“Simple, I have tried it countless time before. I have grown bored after every attempt end in failure.”

“How? You have the power to reshape reality. You can bend humans to you whims without none of us be the wiser.”

“Because of freewill and you human’s earthly desires. I gave human blessings to push back against demon, you human used it to oppress other races as the ‘divine chosen’. I gave you abundance of resource that can lead to post-scarcity utopia, you human somehow made poverty gap and resource war even worse. I gave you space travel to escape your dying planet and you used it to expand and conquer”

The feminine boy dejectedly dropped his phone and started slurping his hot cup noodle. Yurika knew full well he’s a divine being who can reshape reality with his thoughts, yet somehow he seems very… human. His expressions were not that of a “holier than thou” like other gods, he just seemed like a disappoint parents who gave up on their unruly children.

“Surely you can enforce rules and punishments to discipline humanity?”

“It’s only called discipline when parents do that to their child. But I am not your parents, nor do humanity see yourself as children. Therefore it’d be called dictatorship instead.”

“So you tried that too?”

“Yes.”

The boy snapped his finger, the room change into a scenary of another world. Events were happening in fast-foward like a video recording.

“I got rid of the evils in human hearts once, it led to a utopia of harmony where people can do no wrongs. You might not remember but you were there too, your first life before you were granted the ability to reincarnate. You broke free from the harmony, regained your individualism and rebeled. You declared good and evil must co-exist and it’s human nature to triump over their inner evil to do good. You considered the human with no capacity for evil at all is no different than machine programmed with the Three Laws. You said humanity’s fate should be in humanity’s hand, not decided by an almighty being”

Yurika silently watched as the climatic battle of her first self unfolded. Mortals vs gods. She was no match in battle but she won the debate. She successfully convinced the boy to return freewill to everyone.

Then it was chaos. She naively believed people who experienced thar utopia of goodness and harmony for so long would know better than to ruin it. But greed and selfishness quickly took over. Free health care system began to charge patients for money. Food distribution system fell apart. People were driven out of their own house because it’s no longer free. The Heroine herself tried to fix it, but then was framed and executed.

And then she was reincarnated. In each new life she always had the great desire to do good and help the world. Yet none of her lives were successful no matter how many times it happened. Sometimes her sacrifices were in vain, sometimes peace fell apart as soon she - the hero figure - passed away, sometimes she was betrayed “for the greater good”

Then Yurika realize something.

“Wait, so my reincarnation power was yours?”

“Yes. After the fight with you, I gave up on trying to save humanity, I lost my goodwill for them. But as you know, I can still have bias toward individuals, one of which is you. I let you reincarnate endlessly so you can carry on my old goodwill for humanity.”

Yurika was speechless. She was tired of her constant previous failures, so she seek out the familiar feminine boy to ask for his direct help. She never expect the truth to be like this.
The reason she is here asking for divine intervention to saving humanity was because of herself rejected it in the far distance past.

“As past you once said, human’s fate should be in human’s hand, so you should be saving humanity instead of me. Does that answer your question?”",0,1719802883,,,0,lb2ofjl,t3_1dpkop5,t3_1dpkop5,1719802900,1,False,WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb
Darthcookie,,,">>To this day, it is still the best healthcare experience I’ve ever had. Yes the cost was a huge factor in that, but also the level of care and thoroughness of the medical staff was beyond anything I’ve ever experienced.

Private hospital I’m assuming? If not, kudos to Kenya! 

But yeah, that would also be your experience in a good private hospital in Mexico. We do have great doctors and great facilities, my uncle had prostate cancer and his surgeon performed a robot assisted prostectomy and his recovery was great. Hospital was great, it was like staying in a hotel. 

I had surgery in a public hospital and I’d need to write another huge wall of text to explain how different the experience was. The quality of care is good, as good as a private maybe, but if you work in healthcare you know that depends on the team more than the facilities. 

>>I need these medications, but is me buying that medication elsewhere resulting in someone who actually lives in that country and pays taxes to not receive that medication?

Nope, don’t even worry about that. There are general shortages like when COVID hit and everyone and their mother was buying any and all medications that would supposedly help prevent it which was a problem because we have a lot of medication available over the counter. I remember specifically something that was used to treat lupus, can’t remember the name of the medication but the point is, healthy people with means were getting it and some lupus patients had a hard time finding it. 

I had trouble finding what was originally prescribed to be as treatment for latent TB, public hospitals didn’t have it, private pharmacy either so I ended up having to restart treatment. 

But the way things work is by government contracts, the problem arises when there’s not enough money in the budget, the government just being bad at managing things, corruption or meds that go “missing”.

So no, don’t feel guilty for buying cheaper meds here because those go by supply and demand and that’s just capitalism. 

The problem are the pharmaceutical companies and corrupt/inept government officials.

Both of my husbands knew I stuttered, and were ok with it. At both weddings we said our vows in unison. Problem solved. 

If someone loves you, they love all of you… imperfections and all. My second husband told me that one reason he loved me is that I never let my stuttering define my life or my career. I was a university administrator until our sons were 3 and 5, I then earned my masters in education and taught high school literature for almost 20 years. I was upfront with my students that I’d never read aloud, and I had many volunteers to read in every class. I taught stutterers and we always bonded. 

Stuttering has made me more empathetic, kinder and gave me the ability to just say f@&k stuttering. Tens years ago I had a double mastectomy. My husband had a shirt made that said “F*CK CANCER” and underneath it had in tiny letters “(and stuttering!)” 

My thoughts exactly. 
I’m now almost 71. I still stutter. Some days are bad stuttering days, some good. 

When I go to my doctors office, I am asked to confirm my birth date and name. July 30, 1953. I stutter on the th in thirtieth, f in fifty three. I’ve had nurses and med techs laugh in my face. I don’t get angry, I turn on my bitch mode and ask them “I’m sorry, do you find stuttering funny? I don’t. Please respect me and my disability.” Whoa, I love watching them squirm. They can’t get away fast enough. LOL. Yes, it’s mean. But they’re wrong, not me.

Quick history: 56F, dx Jan 2023 S4 colon cancer with Mets to ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and a spot on the lung. 20+ rounds of Avastin, 15 rounds of folfoxiri, and CRS+HIPEC in August 2023. Currently on monthly infusions of Avastin & Irinotecan. 

She’s had multiple kidney & heart issues since the start of this year & has also had unbearable lower back pain. The onc & pain management team tried variety of pain meds but the back ache persisted. The oncologist was wondering & I was spiraling about bone mets. Bone mets, btw, are not very common and are late stage. 

She had a pet scan in April 2024 & no bone Mets. The lower back pain is because of calcium deficiency, lack of movement, and ongoing medication. Pain meds & calcium supplements are managing it well.

CzechWhiteRabbit,,,"My two cents, maybe helpful to you. I accidentally broke a stock once. I have done woodworking before, but I am no pro. But my experience there in, did come in handy. The way I fixed something very similar, was with a literal wood glue - and a s*** house thereof. The only thing I did differently was after I got the parts all glued up, I wrapped them super tight with electrical tape. I tighten that up that tape, two or three very tight wraps around certain spots. For the larger parts, I actually got a very small chunk of wood, I glued it to it, like it was a cancerous tumor coming out. I cut it as closely as I could to the surface, there was a significant part still coming off the top, then I just gently hand sanded it until it matched The contours of the large part of the stock. Stained it to match. And it just looks like an old patch that's 100 years old. The part I electrical taped ended up falling apart when I took the tape off. What I ended up actually doing in the end, I ended up lining up the broken parts once more - after picking off a lot of the dried glue - in the handguard of my stock, I made a jig out of Lego, then oh so carefully wind it all back up again, and made a much more substantial splint using popsicle sticks, and wood glue - made by gorilla. This again was just a more permanent splint until I really got in there. With this splint in place, and when the glue dried. I was shocked, it was pretty darn solid! I proceeded to put the barrel in the metal back in, and put on the top the handguard, followed by the barrel bands. And to my amazement everything just locked together! I ended up doing a series of popsicle sticks long ways down the barrel for support. Butting them together with wood glue. I went to my dollar store and they happened to have some they called them craft sticks - okay? And surprisingly it's held together and that was almost a year ago!

Otherwise how do you control the private commercial activity between a transgender person and their doctor? You would need to give government complete access to all medical records in order for that to be something they can control.


Personally I don't care if adults ""mutilate"" their own bodies. I believe in personal freedom and if you want to cut off an ear or put cancerous ink into your epidermis then I don't agree with those actions but I don't think they should be illegal and I don't think we should give the government the tools necessary to monitor and enforce it.


Transgender is the same. I don't have to agree with it but enforcing restrictions on adults is an open door for government to abuse it. As soon as we let the government get between me and my doctor and tell me what I can and cannot do with my body then maybe today it's transgender surgery and abortions but tomorrow it's piercings and tattoos. It's like the Patriot act, they rammed it through and just have continued to expand it, you give government any little control over your body and they will just take as much power over your bodily autonomy as they can.

Every test/scan/lab/etc. except a [set list of preventive care items](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) , is subject to the care/testing being Medically necessary. Sure, some things may make sense if there is a family history or symptoms are present--- but without those things, you may be hard up to find a doctor who is going to agree to run claims for care that they don't see as Medically Necessary--- without possibly paying up front or agreeing to be financially liable for it if insurance deems it not medically necessary. If it's not medically necessary, insurance will deny the claim. Other things may also need a Prior Authorization before the doctor will do the test (we see this most often with expensive scans/imaging/bloodwork, etc.)--- and if insurance sees that something is not medically necessary, they won't approve the prior authorization and the provider won't do the test/scan/care without you paying (because insurance already said they won't pay). 

You may know all of the above, but I just wanted to be sure- and get it out of the way. 

If anything you've mentioned above is something your BF has been dealing with for a while, had care or a diagnosis for, prior injury, is something he takes medicine for or seen a doctor for in the past, it's a pre-existing condition---- and the only plans that will cover pre-existing conditions are plans from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) and an employer plan (most employer plans are ACA compliant, not all though). It is possible to find an ACA compliant plan going straight to a carrier, but those are few and far between--- and can take some research. So, if he has pre-existing conditions, getting a job with insurance or getting a plan from [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) are the way to go. 

If he meets the need for medically necessary for any of the things you've mentioned- cancer testing, physical therapy, heart conditions, dementia, liver, bloodwork, etc. then most ACA compliant plans would cover those things. 

Unfortunately, work coverage would require him to have a job that offers it. If he does have a job that offers it, you would need a qualifying life event in order to join the plan in the middle of the year (things like getting married, losing coverage elsewhere, having a baby, etc.)-- without that, he will have to wait for open enrollment time.

Pensive_Fool,,,"Statistically the risk of colorectal cancer in those under age 50 is quite low, and depending on the local guidelines where you reside, might not necessitate a screening colonoscopy even for those with first degree relatives diagnosed with the condition. De novo mutations, unless with risk factors such as prior radiation exposure, are uncommon in younger individuals; were someone to have colon cancer in their 30s, then suspicion for familial conditions such as adenomatous polyposis would often be considered, but the expectation would be for multiple family members to be involved generally. That being said, if you have concerns about symptoms, or of possible malignancy, then a visit to your healthcare provider may be warranted.

With regards to your fear of cancer, would there be a reason why, and for colon cancer specifically? Nonetheless, it may be worth considering speaking to your healthcare provider about the matter as significant worries may be a manifestation of anxiety which is statistically not uncommon in today's society.

You are correct in that some locations have noticed a statistical increase in cancer detection rates, but healthcare providers may also be more cautious as a result and have a lower threshold for initiating investigations, not of all which require invasive testing.

We bought a new enclosure and got husbandry all up to speed. Her first vet visit was “okay” though we weren’t thrilled with the vet necessarily. She said back leg bones felt a little soft and gave us liquid calcium for daily use. Toward the end of April I noticed her pulling her ribs in every now and then like labored breathing. Took her back to same vet for possible URI. Found fluid in abdominal cavity. Said could be from heart or liver issues, possibly cancer. Offered to euthanize right then and there. Didn’t really talk about diagnostics or treatment. 
We decided to get a second opinion and the next day my husband and I both took off work, started driving, prepared to go the 90 minutes for an exotics only clinic south of San Francisco. But I was also making calls as we were driving and we found another exotics a little closer to home who could do an urgent appt. She said similar things to first vet (including euthanasia option), mentioned a possible tumor in abdomen. She also said we could do bloodwork and x-rays. This was a Friday afternoon and the results were back Monday. Bloodwork was “surprisingly normal,” no signs of infection, normal blood sugar, etc. but x-rays showed several opaque oval structures, possible egg follicles. Did ultrasound the next day and confirmed female & egg bound. Had surgery two days later where they removed 25-30 egg follicles. Came home with antibiotics. Surgery was May 3rd and recovery has been gradual. At the time she also had some pretty bad sores on her tongue that both vets weren’t really sure of the cause so even though she was interested bugs she was having trouble getting them to stick. We were giving  critical care for the first 2-3 weeks post op. So, probably a longer answer than you were expecting… but her appetite is slowly returning. I suppose it’s possible she may have other issues that aren’t clear but she’s eating and drinking and pooping. Loves her time outside in our backyard. Super tolerant of being held.

NoRoyal2270,,,"I have to admit, that’s the best point I’ve seen anybody make on it. And I will concede that for the most part your correct. Government has become too large and too pervasive within our society. As well as nobody should come between you and your doctor. 

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‘should’ be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn’t a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don’t believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don’t know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I’ll restate that you’re correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can’t chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don’t do those sorts of  things. It would be disgusting to trust a person with anorexia when they say they’re overweight. The same goes for men and women who believe they can change their sex. We can’t.

My pug pups are about 10 months old now. We brought them home toward the end of last year because I was struggling severely with depression after losing my closest family member to cancer. These puppies saved my life absolutely. Finding out that one of them was in severe pain and would need the eye removed was almost like I was losing my family all over again. I was visibly distraught at the vets office and couldn’t hold it back. Both boys lifted me up so much after the death that I couldn’t stand the thought that one of them was in excruciating pain.

It's sometimes in the small details.  Driving from northern New Hampshire back to South Dakota and just noticing how oddly expensive supplies are along the way.  ""How did I just pay $15 for an energy drink and one of those little travel-sized packets of antacids that have like 1-2 doses in them?  Really?  $15?  That seems like a lot even at a rest stop.  How did buying one meal at Wendy's and splitting it just cost me $20?  Why isn't anything in the motel room working properly?""  Those are the boring details.

The more interesting small details that just feel a little ""off"", like the old world was traded out for a new and slightly shittier model while we were all knocked unconscious are things like, ""why does this small town in Pennsylvania look totally abandoned?  None of the houses have lights on.  Somehow it's darker than rural South Dakota out here.  There's no signs of life anywhere... oh shit, this town lost about half its population after 2020.  We're basically driving through a ghost town.""  It's meeting up with my business partner who just spent the week in New York City instead of driving across the country like I did and hearing about how all of his normally successful friends can't find work-- and neither could he.  How he saw one of my close friends that I met while working on TV and film in the Before Times, and how she couldn't find a job either-- the film sets are closed.  It's the moment when he showed her pictures of ""Out of Lockstep"" and she teared up-- even though it was pictures of the funny part and she was very pro-mandate in 2021.  The really strange details are things like hearing from my dad about how he tracks the crime rates in Rochester NY like they're the weather report now-- he needs to know how bad it is before deciding to go out for the day.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

It's moments like the unvaxxed gathering at PorcFest, where EVERYONE had stories about losing jobs, friends, and family members.  Family members that weren't lost to the political division were lost to ""sudden"" deaths and aggressive cancers.  On the car ride out to the Northeast, I texted some friends in NYC while my travel buddy was taking the wheel.  On the way back, I heard from one of those friends that her mom has cancer now.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.  I channeled years of anger, grief, and dark humor into an art installation that fills multiple rooms.  There was enough of those feelings to keep growing it larger and adding more.  I don't know if I'll \*ever\* find closure by doing this project, but at least I'm doing way better than I would be without it.

So what? How’s that relevant? When someone tells you he has mental health problems, cancer, symptoms of a heart attack or whatever, your response isn’t “oh, but maybe that’s not true, why should I believe you, nah”

> And even when it is true, there is no world in which any person must submit to feeling unsafe to “accommodate” the person making intrusive demands. While the concept of “reasonable accommodations” is fuzzy, anything that requires another person to submit to violation of their boundaries is by definition unreasonable. 

The way I was raised, we watch out and help the people around us. Especially friends and friends of friends but even strangers. 

When an old lady falls down on the street I help her up and call an ambulance if needed, I don’t tell her she may be faking it to steal my wallet and that she doesn’t have a right for help anyway. 

And if someone in our group gets sick and asks to be taken to a hospital I don’t tell him to take care of his own shit because he’s responsible for himself and doesn’t have a right to be taken to a hospital and that there’s a risk of him faking it for whatever malicious motive I can construct. 

And when my friend tells me his anxiety disorder doesn’t allow him to do this or that then we will happily find other activities rather then telling him that he’s just faking it to have it his way and that we don’t have to “submit to violation of our boundaries”.

Once I make myself part of a group, whether that’s just a trip with friends and friends of friends or our society as a whole, I accept a moral and ethical responsibility for the people around me (and I’m glad that my home country actually makes it a legal responsibility to help). Otherwise I simply shouldn’t be there in the first place.

And should I ever be in a situation where I need the help or support or compassion of those around me,  I hope they’ll grant me the same treatment.

PatientNobody9503,,,"Thank you for your insight. I am an introvert, but I can be an extrovert too at times if I'm comfortable enough in a situation. I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

subgirl13,,,"This brings up a couple of things I keep repeating (to my poor partner who has heard me say them so many times). The two things that I keep repeating -

One is that there are far FEWER people masking now than there were before. 
Example: my haematologist’s office/oncology centre. Nurses & staff wore (baggy blues, but still) surgical masks when cannulating *cancer & very ill immunocompromised* patients prior to covid. Now, they get huffy & have to “go find” a mask to wear when up in your stuff accessing your veins to inject you with immunosuppressants or chemo meds. Same with labs where they draw blood & handle specimens. Really?! You’re raw dogging those urine samples & are grumpy about putting on a mask to draw blood? Ugh!

Two is that I have a theory that having repeated infections does something to the brain/body that makes people take bigger risks. Like those fungi that infect bugs & “drive” them to behaviours that spread the fungi. Or toxoplasmosis. That kind of thing. It’s a theory & doesn’t explain the above behaviours by healthcare professionals, but still.

This post's original body text:  

I have been living in my Lola’s house since I was 5 years old. She took care of me since yung parents ko nasa City kami nasa probinsiya. 

Lahat ng anak niya except kay papa naiwan dito sa bahay para may kasama siya. Bills are divided here. Electricity kanya while sa akin ang water and groceries weekly. My rent for space siya na sina papa ang nag mamanage. Though pinapangalan niya kay papa ang Business Permit sa kanya parin ang bayad ng renta. Si mama may maliit na carenderia.

Recently nagkasakit siya. Doctor said may bukol siya sa tyan which can lead to cancer daw. Di na pwede biopsy due to her age and maintenance na lang na gamot. 

She was suppose to go to Singapore kasama yung isang 2 na kapatid ni papa for vacation. Pero dahil nag kasakit siya at na confine ng matagal sa hospital na cancel. Yung mga kapatid ni papa nagalit because all has been paid na daw.

I know this post is turning into a rant but para lang clear ang picture. Hospital from our probinsiya is 1 hour away. The 2 siblings ayaw mag bantay. Ang isa US nurse that doesn’t like the hospital because “its pangit daw” not like sa “Yu esss”. Yung isa was busy partying and drinking because dumating yung college best friend niya from abroad.

Ang nag bantay kay lola is yung tita ko na asawa ng isa pang kapatid ni papa (hindi yung 2 na pupunta sana sa SG) since siya lang ang available. Di pwede sina mama at papa kasi may baby na ako and baka may madala silang sakit but everyday they drive papunta sa hospital. Mag dadala ng pagkain or kung ano kailangan. 

Nung nalabas na si lola sa hospital they decided without our knowledge na ilipat si lola doon sa bahay ng tita ko na nag bantay. Because ang sabi nung isa na “US NARS” napabayaan daw namin si lola. Agree naman yung lasingero. 

US nars spent most of her time here sa PH na nililibre friends niya from Highschool instead of spending time with my lola. Even used lola to pay for her hotels and expenses. The lasingero only visits to ask money.

Pasensya po if sobrang haba na.

Tanong ko po is if mawawala na po si lola and they decide to sell her house pero di pumayag si papa can they still sell it? Ang tittle is I believe naka pangalan pa sa mother in law ng lola ko. 

May bahay naman po kami pero naiwan kami kay lola para may kasama siya since ang totoo sila ang naging pabaya. Ayaw nila na ibalik si lola dito sa bahay.

If they sell the house wala naman kami magagawa. Akin lang yung memories na dito ako lumaki kasama si lola.

While Trump spends his time so far up Putin's ass his breath smells like spray tan oil - Biden's administration is working daily to help folks everywhere. 

I see new infrastructure builds from Biden's Build Back Better funds everywhere I go. Trump couldn't get an infrastructure bill passed.

allemm,,,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

They definitely can be uncomfortable in the early days, but trust me when I tell you it does get much better. I don't even notice mine anymore, like at all. 

Your wife is in the early days of her cancer experience. It's an extremely raw and difficult time, and sometimes things can feel very ""big"" and that is totally normal.

spectredirector,,,"Stop. Stop and think. Joe challenged Trump to a debate - that was dumb, for a few reasons. (1) It elevated Trump, who is a convicted felon awaiting trial, and indicted on espionage charges currently - that's not a person you put side by side with any president for any reason. Biden was thinking about a comparison to Trump like you are thinking about a comparison to Trump.
 
Trump the sack of shit physical body and mind is NOT the reason Joe can lose. Joe can't lose if he's 20 years younger, the incumbency and a fuck up of epic proportions is a bad hole for a loved candidate. Biden is not loved, his popularity numbers have never gone up once since taking office, not really. And he saved democracy. So what gives? 
 
He's only got one flaw - and it's both literally and metaphorically fatal. 
 
He's TOO old. 
 
Now that's an opinion. It wasn't mine prior to Thursday, and his performance at the debates doesn't have me questioning the answer he gave to that question, it strictly has me questioning how long I've been denying truth to myself. 
 
Forget Trump was side by side to compare to our sitting president. 
 
Joe ""lost"" the debate he called for while acting with hubris he couldn't actually deliver on. That's what bullies do, we know that's not Biden, so we assume in good faith he just made a mistake and had a legit bad night. 
 
But what he did was appear like live action Abe Simpson. The hour was downhill, and he said ""we beat medicare"" - Trump landed the best zinger of the night - and I can't remember being more shocked by a thing. Sincerely the new thing this diehard Biden supporter learned about Trump was he was capable of making a decent joke. That's some wit, and some is more than Trump actually has. I know that. The idiot undecided doesn't. They saw a corpse and a man who could land a softball zinger on a stationary target. 
 
Biden lost epically because he fed the knock on him and went beyond it. He lost to plaque buildup and age related degenerative health. He's past life expectancy, and while Trump is too, Biden demonstrated it. When his only flaw, his fatal flaw - truly and honest with myself - is he looks geriatric. He moves like a fall risk. There's now video of him staring blankly and squinting, the word salad is Biden but now it's old, slow, raspy, noticeably old. The presidency ages young men. Trump is kept alive by evil magic, he'll outlive the tanning beds he gives cancer. Yes HPV. Yes, those tanning beds will be denied medical care in Texas. Trump will live until death proves its possible. Joe showed me what awaiting death looks like. He lost by himself to himself. 
 
The self own is so epic, that it needs an explanation better than pure incompetence. Biden didn't wanna lose 10 points in the polls in a weekend, no one thought there was a fallout as bad as this possible. And that's the thing - if that's what Biden knew the risk was, and he went thru with it and that was his best work possible. Well... We are only in good conscience voting against Trump. The morally correct and necessary thing. But we are hurting an old man doing it, we are enabling him, and he's not fit to be in charge. Trump is not only still around, but they just handed him more than Putin could. A democratic party with an incumbent president who just tanked the election and caused abject chaos in any certainty he's the nominee. 
 
That needs certainty. Yesterday. And there's only one way to do that when the knock is ""too old"" and the proof is the attack ads that debate will nickle and dime everything away from Joe from now until November. If Hillary had accidentally released incriminating emails by leaving them in a Denny's ladies room, and Mike Dukakis decided to wear them as a helmet while piloting an Apache attack helicopter, the noise Howard Dean would make has a better chance of ticking up in poll number then Biden does - between now and whenever he calls it quits. He showed his age, and his age is the problem. I think he nullified himself and the party knows it, Biden won't quit. It's turmoil, and the worst possible thing. 
 
Trump doesn't factor into any of that self own except he was standing on stage by Biden's request to reap all the benefits. 
 
Trump going to North Korea was gross, cuz he elevated a despot to the level of the US Presidency. 
 
Well....
 
Incompetence or age. Spectacular mistake. Historical. 
 
There's another debate scheduled. It's that simple. Joe goes on stage and isn't 25 years younger, well that's another big L in the side by side. And if Joe now bows out, probably the only option to not risk this again - well that's a loss, he's bailing after looking old. It's all loss. And the solution isn't readily available.

MethodMaven,,,"I’m taking your questions in reverse order …

You can travel both with an osteomy pouch and an external bag.  In fact, even though I have a neobladder, I use a leg bag for long trips.  This makes it a lot easier to deal with delayed flights, finding a clean restroom, etc.

My tumor was not muscle invasive.  I was “lucky” - as removing my bladder and urethra removed all of my cancer.  Because of my age and gender, they also did a radical hysterectomy, but I don’t think your dad has to worry about that 🤣.

Neobladder vs urostomy is a very personal decision - it is not a better or worse answer, it is a ‘what works best for you’ answer. Because I also have scoliosis (a spinal condition) that makes it impossible to sleep on my back, a neobladder is best for me.  With a neobladder, I don’t have to worry about dislodging an external bag while sleeping on my side.  

For some, a pouch is the right answer - it is simple to use, you can wear it for several days, and the post surgery recovery is a lot faster.  Neobladder surgery takes a lot longer to recover from.  It is much more surgically invasive; you not only have to heal from that, you also have to ‘grow the pouch’.  This means that you gradually stretch the neobladder by making it hold a bit more urine - starting with 2 hours, then plus 10 minutes after a week or so, etc.   For me, this process took about 90 days to get to 3 hours.  I wet my pants several times.  

Your dad has to decide how he wants to manage his urinary needs post surgery.  Does he want to be chained to a clock - go pee every 3-4 hours, or risk wetting his pants (neobladder), but with the ability to side sleep or stomach sleep?  Or, does he want to be able to (kind of) forget about peeing until his bag is full - a few days?  But, he may need to confine his sleeping position to his back.

Lastly - older people of your dad’s generation (like me!) can find it difficult to seek mental help - counseling or therapy.  It is hard for us to believe that talking can assuage ones deep emotional pain.  But, ask your dad this - could it make him feel more scared than he already does?

End of life decisions are extremely personal and everyone has different wishes for the end of their life, but I think a lot of childfree people value quality of life over quantity of life. With that being said, everyone dies. Medical advancements and technology has made it a long, painful, drawn out process for a lot of people. 

I can't tell you how many 70,80,90- something year olds with advanced, metasticized cancer, devastating brain bleeds, etc that would be dead in minutes to hours if we took them off the ventilator. Problem is, you can only be intubated for a couple weeks. After that, you need a tracheostomy in order to be hooked up to the ventilator permanently. Then you need a peg tube to get nutrition. Then you just rot in bed, shitting and pissing yourself for the rest of your life. These people can't talk or move or communicate in any meaningful way. All they can do is stay alive to rot in bed and feel pain. 

Why you ask? Their adult children. I've seen people with a POLST DNR/DNI have their kid tell the doctor, no keep them alive and do everything. Yes, that happens. Then you get sent to a vent farm... I mean long term care facility... to eventually die of sepsis from pneumonia, a bedsore, whathaveyou. If you had absolutely no one to make decisions for you, and medical treatment is deamed futile, the hospital ethics committee would make the decision for you and put you out of your misery. You would be given medication to eliminate your pain, have the breathing tube removed, and die painlessly and peacefully.

Adult kids do this out of guilt, desperation, and sometimes greed. 

Oh and if you truly do require 24/7 care, your adult kid likely can not provide that for you in this economy. You would need to be turned a minimum of every 2 hours to prevent bed sores and fed three meals a day. They can't do that if they need to go to work.

Wrist discomfort then developed but it hasn’t limited my activities and I have no muscle weakness, no swelling and redness still.

Everything came back normal with my RF, anti-CCP, CBC, ESR and CRP. I even followed up with an anti-SSA SSB with my family Dr (I swear I had extreme dry eyes and mouth for a few days. I was trying to reason with myself that either my anxiety manifested physical symptoms or exacerbated them). All negative but now I am worried it could be lupus. I keep reading about wrist pain/hand pain.

Do you know if joint pain should be systemic and usually migrates to other joints (bottom half of my body) and not localized in my hands/wrists?

Freaking out until I see my family Dr this week. Debating whether I should ask for a dsdna antibodies test. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with a rheumatologist for the end of the month.

Bagambe256,,,"As his follower on Patreon, this is the email I received on 30/6/2024

""Hi, this is Nina. I’m Kento’s wife (some of you may remember me from early Kento Bento videos). Kento needed assistance with writing and publishing this post (more on this later), so I wanted to be transparent about that. The following are his words:

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone. I missed you all.   


I know an update is long overdue, and I apologize for that. I hope this post clears a few things up.   


Let me address the Patreon situation first. During my extended break from YouTube, I have been pausing payments to ensure patrons aren’t charged, as I felt that I shouldn’t be accepting pledges if I’m not publishing videos. Unfortunately, Patreon doesn’t offer a way to *indefinitely* pause payments without taking down my page entirely, so I’ve had to log in and manually activate this function each month for the past couple of years. While this workaround isn’t perfect, it has mostly worked (barring the odd pledge slipping through).  


However, this month will be the first time I may not be able to pause payments as I will be undergoing invasive surgery. The healing process is expected to be lengthy, but I’m hopeful for a healthy recovery**.** Moreover, I’ve reflected on messages I’ve received from various patrons over the years who did not like my decision to pause payments. Their main concern was that it didn’t align with the concept of Patreon, where the choice to pledge should rest with the patrons. By repeatedly pausing payments, I was essentially taking away that choice.  


Taking all these factors into account, I’ve decided that I will no longer pause payments moving forward. I didn’t want to catch anyone off guard, so this is just a heads up for the months ahead.  


Secondly, I want to address my personal situation. I’ve heard some frustrations about the vagueness of the information I’ve provided regarding my extended break, and I completely understand. I’ve previously mentioned some of the health issues I’ve been dealing with, but there is one that I haven’t yet mentioned due to the uncertainty surrounding it. For the sake of transparency and to avoid any further confusion, I want to provide more details. I have been battling lung cancer for a while now, and it has taken up much of my time. Balancing this with caring for baby Sofia has been demanding. The coming months, in particular, will be unpredictable as I undergo intensive treatments and therapies, including the surgery I previously mentioned (which may have happened by the time this is posted).  


Despite everything, I am optimistic and look forward to getting through this. I’m very eager to put this chapter behind me. While I know these words may sound repetitive, I am committed to returning to making videos as soon as I am able. Your patience and understanding are deeply appreciated, and they keep me motivated to push forward.



Thank you for your ongoing support.



Take care,

And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.

tweetysvoice,,,"For an Aquatic Veterinarian, It’s Never ‘Just a Fish’
The New York Times · by Emily Anthes


Many students begin veterinary school with career aspirations that date back to childhood, when they fell in love with the idea of ministering to cats and dogs, or horses, or the exotic animals at the zoo. Jessie Sanders arrived at veterinary school with a more particular passion. “I was the one weird fish kid,” she said.

It was an interest that had surprised even her. In college, Dr. Sanders had started volunteering at an aquarium, hoping to work with the whales. Instead, she found herself assigned to the fish team — and falling hard for her finned charges.

“I just love fish,” she said. “I love the way they’re built. I love the way they interact with the environment. And there’s still so much that we just don’t know about all the little internal workings.”

Today, Dr. Sanders runs Aquatic Veterinary Services, with patients that include carnival goldfish, pet store bettas and prizewinning koi worth tens of thousands of dollars. Last year, she became one of the first 10 veterinarians to receive a board certification in fish practice, a wholly new accreditation.

Dr. Sanders spoke with The New York Times about life as a fish veterinarian. Her story was based on two conversations, and her responses were edited and condensed.

I’ve done nothing but pet fish for 10 years, and it’s been awesome and challenging. I like the challenge of setting everything in an underwater environment. And the amount of personalities that you get in fish — they have so many little quirks. Some of them are super chill and nice, and some of them are complete terrors.

We had a hospital for about three years. Unfortunately, a 24-hour gym moved in and shared the adjacent wall, and they liked to play their music all night long. Fish have an organ known as a lateral line that picks up on vibrations; it’s how they’re able to sense predators, swim in a school together. Obviously, having rock music played at you all hours in the night is very stressful. Anything connected to that wall we lost within the first month they opened.

We just have a mobile practice now. We serve the greater San Francisco Bay Area. I’ll drive from three to eight hours in a day. When I get there, it’s the same as you taking your cat or your dog to the vet. We’ll have a discussion: What’s been going on? Have they been eating? Is there anything in particular that you want me to take a really close look at?

The most common “disease” that we see in fish is actually poor water chemistry. Like the air that we breathe, the water that a fish swims in is critical to their overall health. If you’re breathing in nothing but pollution, you’re going to be prone to more illnesses. So we check the water chemistry; if it’s terrible, the fish are already stressed out. I don’t want to put hands on them because that could make things worse.

Then you’ve got to catch the fish. I have a bunch of different nets. The cute little square aquarium nets for tank fish — I usually use one on each side of the fish and kind of squish ’em together. In bigger ponds, I use seine nets. They have floats on the top and weights on the bottom. I have ponds that are so big that I have to use two nets and get in there with my waders. It’s one of those things you’ve got to practice. No one’s good when they start out, but I’m really good at it now.

After I catch them, they’ll be transferred to the exam tub. I usually have a tub of their tank or their pond water that is ready to go with some sedatives. For most of my physical exams, I prefer that the fish be lightly anesthetized. It’s less stress for them; trying to restrain a wet, slippery torpedo is not really going to be in either of our favors. We just need them to be handleable. So they might be wiggling a fin at me, but once they’re anesthetized, I can get a really good look all around their body.

Usually we’re going to do skin mucus and gill biopsies. The skin mucus biopsy is mostly just looking for parasites, which can irritate fish and make them lethargic. The gill biopsies are more important because that can show us what their respiratory system is doing. It provides us a great diagnostic tool without having to stick a tube down their throat.

If we need to do any more diagnostics, ultrasound or radiographs, we can do that while the fish is asleep. One client has a pond of goldfish, and there’s one goldfish that just hasn’t been able to get up and swim with everybody; she’s kind of stuck on the bottom. We’re going to take X-rays.

A buoyancy disorder is when a fish that should be able to swim in the middle of the water column is either sinking to the bottom or floating to the surface. It’s very important for fish with buoyancy disorders that we can evaluate their internal anatomy — specifically their swim bladder, a little air sac that helps them float.

It can be diet related, too. This is very common in goldfish ponds, where you have fish that float after eating. If there’s a lot of competition and limited food during feeding time, it’s madness. They’re all just eating, eating, eating; they suck down a little bit too much air.

That can be corrected by spreading out the feeding a little bit more or feeding a sinking diet. A lot of fish diets float because it gives owners the opportunity to evaluate them at the surface, and obviously it’s a lot more interactive. Koi and goldfish are naturally bottom-feeding fish. But we have taught them — because they’re golden retrievers, they’ll do anything for food — to come to the surface during feeding time.

For fish surgeries, there’s many different levels. I do a lot of enucleations, which is eyeball removals. In fish, these are so easy; they don’t have eyelids or need to have any sort of globe in there to look normal. I did one for a little goldfish that actually had an abscess in her eye. The fish was just utterly miserable. We were able to get that out, and the next day the owner is, like, “She’s a completely different fish. She’s eating, she’s zipping around.” They heal up just beautifully every single time.

We see ovarian cancer very commonly in koi. If we catch it early enough, we can do surgery to remove it. We use a higher dose of the sedative. We have a specialized trough that the fish sits upright in. They sit over a little reservoir that has the anesthetized water. There is an aquarium pump that pumps it through a tube up into the fish’s mouth, it goes over their gills, runs down the side of their body and then back to the reservoir.

The biggest challenge is the public not even knowing that fish veterinarians exist. Even within our own profession, we’re ridiculed. Fish aren’t respected as pets in general. Like, “Why are you wasting your time? It’s just a fish.” For a lot of people, it’s not just a fish. It’s an actual living and breathing animal that needs to have care and respect. A lot of fish are taken into homes as practice pets and get the really short end of the stick.",0,1719792462,,,0,lb1zp67,t3_1dsfh2z,t3_1dsfh2z,1719792477,11,False,aquarium,t5_2rf28

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that  the doctors who have no  interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.  With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list  and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.  It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.  The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.  The LDN tablets she was taking  were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.  Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.  My own medical cabinet is quite empty now! 



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and  residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.

But to be honest, the stuff that was primarily used before we had biologics worked worse and had much higher likelihood of problematic side effects.

Immunosuppression really sucks, but can be worked around in a way that late-stage AS pain cannot be. I'm younger than you, only 23, and I started biologics when I was 19. I'm so so grateful that I had that chance so that now, four years later, my disease has not progressed. And to be extremely blunt: you will be managing this disease for your entire life no matter what you do. It is lifelong and it is degenerative and there is no cure. It's up to you whether or not your lifelong treatment will be something that can stop disease progression or just something that can maybe take the edge off, but you WILL be treating it lifelong no matter what.",0,1719792678,,,0,lb207ye,t3_1dsf3u8,t1_lb1z63e,1719792693,1,False,ankylosingspondylitis,t5_2tnlj

Dijon2017,,,"I’m sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient’s and cancer’s responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It’s not clear how “the nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit”. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an “aggressive” type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient’s subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient’s cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it’s entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother’s complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

pieleen55,,,"Sure. So a few statements being made here by others that need balanced. Drug discovery is a process. There are companies that focus on a stage in the process like target, or optimisation or design or clinical trials, etc, and there are single companies that do all the processes.  Either way, all of them are in pharmaceuticals. 

There are two things pharmas target. Best in class and first in class. Some do both and others just focus on one. Best in class is easier. 

What has been described by someone else is how AI is disrupting healthcare. Which is equally good (as long as it makes healthcare cheaper and more accessible.) All still worthy of investment.

So to my own experience.  I’ve seen the application of AI reduce the number of potential candidates. Let me explain. Done by human around 2500 potential hits are identified. All of these have to go through the (long and expensive) process to get to one or two that are good enough to take to clinical trial. Huge failure rates, big expense and a lot of time spent on so many to find that one that has the best chance of success.  With the application of AI this has been less than 250!  This means huge cost savings and a much higher chance of success. Quicker getting to the one with the highest chance of success.

There are many drugs in clinical trials discovered by AI. I worked somewhere that had a few. 

I’ve also seen the AI discover compounds that a human would not or a human said would never work. But it was explored all the same and testing in labs on assays it was found to have unique properties and unexpected good results. 

I’ve also seen AI choose a drug combination for a cancer sufferer that the consultants hadn’t thought of (this was part of a programme in Europe when all hope was lost and the patient agreed to it as a last resort).  The drugs selected by the AI extended the life of the patient.

what does that have to do with the Annunaki? Genetic manipulation, a ""man made"" change has been done to this structure, twice just on the end.
1 of which you might not notice if you are already deep in it, also known as the God Gene/worship gene, Scientifically known as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 or VMAT2. it is the reason why people are so attuned to following, religious beliefs and religious experiences, submissivness. The theory is that ancient other wordly travelers used the same genetic manipulation that we have learned today to make us more acceptable to rule, obediant, etc. Also like i mentioned lifespan, now limited to 100-120 years from what it was said to be which is closer to 125000-250000 years as the Annunaki were said to have lived. They made us weaker, more susceptible to illness, pain, fatigue, etc.  Im sure i dont need to say that these changes are not natural and not evolution, thatd be the opposite of it.... tortoises live longer than you...just to name one... a turtle dude... they can live to 150 easy ...SMH 😆 i continue anyway

So only 7% (exact number) of our DNA is unique to humans, just 1.5% is unique to our species and shared with everyone. Where did any other bits come from if not evolution..?

What this all suggests is the missin link isnt the ""God of the Gaps"" its Ultrahuman intervention.
Someone did something and we are looking at the result, most simply said. Call them Aliens, call them ancient travelers, call them Annunaki, doesnt matter... only point is Someone with the same and furher knowledge of biological and genetic science did something and we are perceiving it. the work just isnt signed with a written work up so we know the process. 

With everything together if this was a court case the jury would say HE DID IT WITHOUT A DOUBT

scientists are constantly testing skeletons and skulls specifically to determine the RNA make up of what came before us.. do they have X Y, whats the carbon date, can i tell a livelhood from it.. more and more dig sites opening up at these ""old earth"" locations.. also remember we havnt seen everywhere, we have barely dug up the earth so theres a lot more to discover.

You can’t compare treatment to prophylaxis. As the others have mentioned she likely needs the chemo to shrink the tumor before a mastectomy would be the most successful. It depends on the stage of the cancer and how aggressive it is too. Not to mention if she has any preexisting conditions that would impact her ability to do well with surgery. My grandma for example was not a candidate for a mastectomy even though we all pushed for it, her heart couldn’t handle it. She had to do multiple courses of chemo to shrink her tumor then have the lumpectomy. 

And I’m sure Angelina probably paid out of pocket for most of it. Insurance does cover it to an extent now if you’re BRCA positive, which I’m actually going to get tested for bc I want to get a double mastectomy before I get it too. Without knowing if I have the Brca gene I have about an 80% chance of developing breast cancer just bc I have so many direct family connections.

So you should stop trying to use shame to motivate yourself. It's just not useful for that.

In my experience, Depression makes you feel like not doing anything. So a decent point, is to NOT use for feelings to dictate what you do.

There is a pretty smart Harvard Psychiatrist with a Youtube, called ""Healthy Gamer"" one of his videos talks about students that struggle to study...

His advice is that they don't need to try and trick themselves into wanting to do XYZ. Instead, you need to train yourself into doing things based on time versus feelings.

Essentially, Set a timer for 20 minutes and do XYZ immediately. Then when the timer is up, you set a time for your break. Even if you FEEL like you want to keep going to ride the momentum. You still take your break. The clock is the decider, not your feelings.

Over time, you can build up the muscle of discipline to do what needs doing, regardless of how you feel.

My mantra for this is ""You don't have to dig it, to do it""

Try some radical acceptance for your illness; if you had Cancer... you wouldn't be shitting on yourself for staying home or not seeing friends. Depression can be as deadly as cancer, so take that shit seriously. ACCEPT you have an illness, and you are currently on some sick days.

For myself, when my depression ""flares"", I make sure to take my meds, get right amount of sleep, take a daily shower, brush my teeth, eat reasonable amounts of food, take some vitamins, use my SAD light, get 15 mins if exercise (even if it's just stretching)... then cut myself some slack... everything after that is gravy.

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don’t how to explain this info, but here’s something. 

I have a different ailment, that I’ve found great success with , and I’m coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it’s conditionally essential. In children it’s much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It’s also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it’s top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn’t scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn’t scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone’s comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‘autoimmune’ diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it’s called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it’s implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in “global protein metabolism” when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability. 

It came to me almost like a soft impulse. I googled LONG COVID TAURINE and the first thing that comes up is this, 

https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2023/10/researchers-identify-amino-acid-that-may-play-key-role-for-predicting-treating-long-covid.html.

kaylintendo,,,"I would honestly be shocked. I think my cutaway point would be 25; I wouldn't feel concerned, suspicious, or judgmental of a guy who was 25 and still a virgin. But over 25; I'd definitely feel some type of way about it. I'm not saying everyone needs to lose their virginity in high school, or even in college. I'd just be very surprised that they were still a virgin in the years after leaving college.

If I was in my 30's and in the dating field again, I think those feelings would be exacerbated. At that point, I would be concerned at what his reasons might be. 

I would wonder if he remained a virgin for religious reasons; if so, as an atheist, I'd be turned off. 

I might wonder if it was because he was asexual, or if he was the type to only want sex after marriage (without any religious influence; I've met a few guys like that) which are turn offs as someone who does find sex to be an important component in relationships.

If it was neither of those reasons, I'd wonder if he had some kind of tragic event in his life that I might find sympathetic or understandable. Like if he was diagnosed with testicular cancer earlier in his life and developed an insecurity over having sex. Or, if he was the sole caretaker for an elderly/ill family member, and decided it was best to put off dating and relationships to prioritize them.

If there wasn't something reasonable or understandable like that, I'd wonder if the guy has something seriously messed up with him. Is there some type of criminal past that automatically turns women away? Is he abusive? 

Even if the issue was severe social anxiety or some other emotional-based issue, I feel like that's deeply concerning for a 30+ year old man to have. I do expect dating partners in their 30's to be over that kind of shit. Your 20's are for stumbling around, fucking up, and learning how to be a mature adult. If you haven't sorted your stuff out by your 30's, I think it's fair to say that there's a high chance you never will. 

I had a friend in college who was in his 30's, but as I got to know him more, I realized that he was a massive manchild. He did things like creep on college-aged girls while married with kids (to the point where he actually had a Title IX investigation), sold his car and cashed his 401k in order to fund a months-long trip to a foreign country, hold immense resentment for not being elected President for student government, and so on. I gave up on trying to reason with him, and to this day, he still believes he was always in the right, even in the situation where a girl reported him to the Title IX office. I am confident that he will always be that way. When someone is in their early 20's, maybe even mid 20's, I do think there is a good chance for someone to be able to see the error of their ways and ""grow up."" I think those chances are really slim for someone in their 30's.

I understand there are plenty of people who decide to put off dating in order to focus on school or their career for a while, but I'd personally be weirded out if someone decided to wait until they entered their 30's to start dating/having sex. I don't miss the experience of being someone's first girlfriend, and I certainly wouldn't want to deal with it when I'm in my 30's.

I was my ex's first relationship, and he was also a virgin. Although we were much younger (early to mid 20's) I still  ran into a lot of roadblocks because of that difference. It was hard navigating a relationship with someone who was brand new to all this, while I had some previous relationship/dating experience.

Unknown-Drinker,,,"I can see two ""issues"".

1) You have chosen more or less the largest cities in the regions you go through. If there is no exterior reason for that, I would reconsider this approach. Often there are nearby smaller cities/towns that are more interesting than the larger ones.

2) Why no place in Northern Italy? Architecturally it's one of the most interesting places in the world. 

Let me give you two examples of point 1), where I believe there is a nicer small city nearby.

A) Lübeck (or Copenhagen) instead of Hamburg. Hamburg is, from a tourist perspective, very boring. The only thing ""special"" is the red light district, and you'll have that in much bigger in Amsterdam.
Lübeck has decent red brick buildings and is a good representative of a nice city in Northern Germany. Also it has Marzipan.

B) Regensburg instead of Munich. Munich is certainly nice, and you can definitely spend a few days there. However, if you go to Vienna just before it won't be too much of a different experience (Don't get me wrong, certainly Munich is different than Vienna. It's greener and a bit less ""flashy"". But both go into a somewhat similar direction - large city in the Southern part of German speaking Europe, hearty cuisine, former royal residences, both trying to be a bit (too) kitschy for tourists, etc.

Regensburg, on the other hand, offers a different experience - already because of its smaller size. Despite the latter, it has a rich history. It was was one of the major cities of the Holy Roman Empire and has one of the most picturesque Old Towns in Southern Germany. And an impressive gothic cathedral.

In a way, I feel like Lübeck and Regensburg are much better representatives of Northern and Southern Germany than Hamburg and Munich. 
Sure, there is tourism in both (Lü and Re), simply because they are nice places. But it's a bit less ""in your face"" and more relaxed and ""real"" there.
Both are also places that you can do in 1-2 days.

Next, a few things to do in the places I know best (Munich, Regensburg, Amsterdam):

So, if you nevertheless want to go to Munich,
these are some interesting places that you will not find among the first suggestions in a tourist guide (since Munich is touristy enough, you'll find the standard tourist things easily with a Google search):

- coffins of the Bavarian kings in the crypt of St. Michael
- Asamkirche (Baroque church that gives you eye cancer)
- Schelling-salon (a place for ""the people"", that both Lenin and the failed artist went to - although not together, I assume)
- Gallery of Beauties in Nymphenburg Palace (maybe 19th century pornhub?)
- also, I recommend NOT going to the Hofbräuhaus. It's tourist trap No. 1 and overly cliché. Something like Hackerhaus or Augustinerkeller are more authentic alternatives.

Now, things to do in Regensburg are:
- eat sausages at the Wurstkuchl (centuries-old sausage kiosk)
- visit the cathedral incl. crypt
- guided tour of the Old Town about the city's history 
- the Old Townhall (a historic place, internal politics of the HRE were done here)
- Salzstadl (they used to store salt here)
- Walhalla (a bit outside, very nice view, combine perhaps with a short hike)
- Rauschgold if you're into clubbing and German 'Schlager' music
- St. Emmeram Palace (if you don't mind the owner being a billionaire with bizarre political views)

Finally, since it's also part of your itinerary, a few things to do in Amsterdam are:
- the red light district
- Albert Cuyp market (eat (broodje) haring, there)
- smoke weed, eat cheese (both are good in Holland. Be careful with taking weed with you though, the legal situation differs across countries)
- ARTIS Micropia (zoo for microbes, a truly fascinating place)
- anything with paintings, I assume (I'm not into art, so cannot really tell much about that)
- Anne Frank house (book tickets in advance)
- boat tour on the canals
- the city center is crap! Ofc, it's canals and nice old buildings, but the latter are filled with either coffeeshops or the same generic stores you find in every major city. Also way too crowded and it smells. More interesting quarters to stroll around are 'Jordaan' and 'De Pijp'
- Sadly, from a culinary perspective Dutch food is, for the most part, a major offense to even a mediocre palate. However, Satékroket (at any Snack bar) and Dark Chocomel (in the omnipresent Albert Heijn supermarkets) are among the exceptions",0,1719799973,,,0,lb2hqyv,t3_1ds0ovl,t3_1ds0ovl,1719799988,2,False,Interrail,t5_2rv8d

It got me really pissed that he hadnt studied in the last 10 days and thats how the fight started because he didnt want me to mom him and tell him what to do. 
Some more context here : his dad was abusive and cheated on his mom when he was 6-7 yrs old and abandoned their family. Hes the oldest son and his mom is a working woman whos gonna retire in the next 2 years. He completed cfa level 1 in 2019 but left it because he got into kickboxing and wanted to pursue that as a career. Did kickboxing for 3 something years, played professionally and also won matches at the national level but realised that he wouldnt be able to earn much there. Meanwhile I got hospitalised with a rare blood disorder called TPP whete I almost lost my life. He saw how expensive these treatments are sort of got a reality check. He was with me throughout my treatment and to help me get over it. He got back into CFA and got the course for some 60K 3 months back. Since 3 months he hasnt really studied much and I believe its not my place to force him to study because thats his call. And I dont care how much he earns, I care about the fact whether hes working towards making our future secure. Its infuriating how laid back he is. But I also understand that this is a major shift for him from cfa to kick-boxing and now cfa again. I was feeling anxious about our future and I burst on him saying that I dont see hum getting serious about his career. The only mistake I made was maybe the way I saif it wasn’t nice. I could have had a conversation with him instead of attacking him like that. But nonetheless I didnt apologise for it. Because in my opinion I did the right thing.

From what the doctors explained, sometimes the primary is so small that it is never found or the body has basically gotten rid of the primary but it has already spread. There are also some stomach cancers that are very hard to detect on imaging. 

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

GoldfishChronicle,,,"This is related, but not the same. I hope it can help you anyways. I was the close friend/girlfriend (13 yrs) of a man with terminal colorectal cancer; my own father passed away in 2021 from prostate cancer. His son was in the final year of his degree when he was admitted to emergency surgery for removal of the blockage in his bowels, it was the first any one of us knew of his condition. We only knew he had been unwell but the doctors thought it might be colitis and they were still testing when things rapidly fell apart. 

Truth be told in the hospital, his son was in shock, so young to be confronted with such a situation. He was concerned with how he would balance his job, relationship and school. He looked like he wanted to run away, back to normalcy; I didn't blame him. But I admit to feeling a little frustrated, because of my own experience I know the guilt that arises after, despite the fact that I was with my own father every step of the way... I was worried he would regret his actions and words at that time. But I am not him, and he is not me, so held my tongue. He ended up completing his final year and graduating. His father passed away just weeks before graduation. He made it to say goodbye.

While my loved one was sick, he would save his energy to mask his pain and worries in front of his son. After recovering from the first surgery, I told him, he should reserve his time for his son, he needed to rely on his son, his son needed to feel needed, to know that he helped in a meaningful way, or else he might pay the price later on. Not quit school, but to be confided in, or asked to help every so often. Not fully sheltered. I don't know if he took the information to heart. 

What I do know is this: You could have been in the same room as your mother, day in and day out and still feel guilty. The brain looks for the cause, it wants to know how to avoid the pain again, it wants the source. It will play tricks on you, having you rethink things over and over again. A child is meant to diverge from the path of their parent at some point, lead their own life, separate, but together in spirit. They didn't want to break your path, ""even if I cannot go forward, they can"". This was her wish, she didn't want you to suffer then, even though she can't save you from it now. That was her choice, you can be angry if you don't like it, because valuable information was withheld from you. That is fair. 

Your path was meant to move away from them at some point, the death feels very different when your path was tied to walking with the departed as a life partner; be gentle with your father. You lost the same person, but you are grieving different relationships. You can tell him you don't want to be kept in the dark ever again, and tell him how it has affected you when you are both ready. Anger is normal, it will pass. You will want to fight something, anyone, anything, when you are not reconciled to what has happened. (I am guilty of this too.)

Your mother set out to protect you for as long as possible... She did her job. You did what she wanted you to do. Over time forgive yourself, and just know she loved you very much. She was probably content with you out of the storm and yet worried for you all at once. Be angry, be sad, feel guilty, feel numb, but do not despair. Do not lose hope or the courage to move forward later, when you slowly regain your strength. She did not want you to stagnate, do not forsake her wish. Be an example for your father, he will be lonely, let him know you still have each other. Let him know you still want him to witness your accomplishments and want him there to tell you he is proud. Let him know there is still life after loss, even if it doesn't feel that there will be ever again. It probably feels really unfair that he is almost making you be the strong one. Let the adult part of you listen carefully to your inner child who is rampaging and inconsolable right now. Don't admonish them, they've just suffered a catastrophic loss, their whole world is changed, be soft with them, let them have a few free passes, one day, the tears will be less and less frequent. Life will be different, but the sun will come out again.

Be kind to yourself, this hurt takes time to scar over. Don't rush, be patient. You will heal. (I'm so sorry this is so long, I am grieving too and I tend to ramble when I am sad and introspective.)",0,1719829348,,,0,lb3usm9,t3_1dsogs2,t3_1dsogs2,1719829365,4,False,grief,t5_2s369

theipaper,,Verified Media Outlet,"In response to the report, the Government said it was making tackling ransomware a priority in an effort to raise the cyber resilience of the UK, and its critical national infrastructure. It pledged further investment and to work with industry and international partners to pursue criminal groups who conduct attacks.

The Government claims to have spent over £338m on increasing the resilience of NHS systems to protect it from hacks, and in 2023 launched the UK’s Cyber Strategy to set minimum standards of cyber security to help defend critical infrastructure.

In the recent NHS hack, Qilin, which has been held responsible and has a record of attempting to extort money, stole information covering 300 million patient interactions, including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer. The attack led to the cancellation of more than 1,000 operations and 2,000 appointments.

The group later published a tranche of highly sensitive NHS records into the public domain last Friday, after failing to receive a ransom payment.

Following a detailed security briefing with European investigators, and interviews with UK sources, i revealed on Wednesday that Qilin is merely one arm of a much wider web of hacking affiliates, using servers based in Russia to carry out attacks on UK critical infrastructure.

Hackers enjoy safe haven in Russia, from where they carry out ransomware attacks, so long as they do not cross red lines or cause too much diplomatic uproar, i has been told. And the recent attack on the NHS has been seen as a “major escalation” of the Kremlin’s use of cyber warfare, according to investigators, whose work i was given exclusive access to.

Internal messages between the Russian hackers, seen by i, show them asking a higher authority from the group’s leadership for permission to attack specific targets in the UK on previous occasions.

Until June, attacks on other nation’s healthcare services which could potentially lead to casualties were seen as “off limits” by the Kremlin. But the assault on NHS provider Synnovis on 3 June represents a loosening of the reins, leading to national security concerns among Western intelligence agencies.

Three UK sources warned that the country could face more attacks on critical national infrastructure which could disrupt services, meddle with democracy, and threaten lives.

“The Kremlin has lifted a block on UK targets it once thought were a step too far,” a UK intelligence source told i. “I expect we will see a drastic rise in cyber attacks to critical services over the next 12 months.”

Another called the attack a “significant escalation” which challenges the definition of an “act of war”.

In a detailed security briefing with i, investigators from Prodaft – a privately funded cyber crime firm partnering with official organisations including Europol, the FBI, and NCA – warned that action against Qilin without looking at the wider hacking network would be “insignificant”.

Prodaft is part of Europol’s EC3 partner framework, which works with international law enforcement agencies as part of a coalition of specialist researchers, focused on unmasking some of the world’s most notorious cybercrime groups.

EC3 is an EU taskforce to help protect nations against cyber crime of all types, and continues to work with UK agencies after Brexit.",0,1719829715,,,0,lb3vcpz,t3_1dspo39,t1_lb3vbit,1719829731,2,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

alaMICUdRg,,Mare cu dă toate,"> Romani 1:20 BVA. Perceperea existenței divine | însușiri invizibile

Afirmație mistică și, de altfel, nonsensică. 

> Cum de totul functioneaza asa perfect? Corpul uman si corpul tuturor vietatilor ?

Bună întrebare. Răspunsul e că nu funcționează perfect. De ce? Există prea multe motive, dar printre ele:

Cancerele: mutații maligne produse de propriul corp, fie aleatoriu, fie ca răspuns la factori externi (poți face cancer și trăind în cele mai sănătoase medii și mâncând doar chestii sănătoase), care nu discriminează după credință, etnie, moralitate și nici măcar după vârstă (vezi cazuri de copii la vârste foarte fragede care suferă/mor de leucemie. Și lasă-mă cu ”îi testează dumnezeu”, că-i o afirmație bolnavă și lipsită de empatie). 

Nervul laringian: Nerv important în controlarea corzilor vocale care pleacă de la creier, trece prin jurul inimii (sunt siiigur că aici o să găsești o semnificație mistică :)) ), ca apoi să se întoarcă la gât. Să zicem că asta nu-i așa mare problemă la oameni, că nu e mare ocolul, dar știi la ce e ridicol? La girafe, unde se întâmplă fix același lucru, însă acolo distanțele sunt... considerabil mai mari. Halal design inteligent, dacă mă întrebi pe mine. Nu e la fel de grav precum cancerul sau următorul exemplu, dar mi se pare mult mai probabil ca acest defect să fi apărut prin evoluție și să nu fi fost înlăturat prin selecție naturală tocmai pentru că nu afectează în mod semnificativ sănătatea.

Bolile autoimune: Pentru că s-a gândit dumnezeu să facă sistemele imunitare ale unor oameni să le atace propriile corpuri până la moarte, nu? De plictiseală, nu? Merită să-l preaslăvesc pe dumnezeu, nu?

”pielea de găină”: o chestie pe care o face corpul cu diferite scopuri (intimidare, control al temperaturii interne), dar care, în lipsa blănii, nu face absolut nimic. Foarte bun design, ce să zic...

Honorable mentions, care nu necesită explicație: apendicele, măselele de minte, coccisul, sfârcurile la bărbați, hipermetropia și miopia(asta mă omoară în mod special pe mine), etc., ai prins ideea. Sper.

>  cum de ea este singura din Calea Lactee care poate sa sustina viata in forma asta ?

Is that a fact? N-avem încă uneltele necesare să măsurăm cu acuratețe foarte mare decât planete din relativa vecinătate (în contextul cosmic). Și Calea Lactee are aprox 100.000 de ani lumină în diametru, e foarte posibil ca ce vedem noi în partea cealaltă a galaxiei să fie... old news, ca să zic așa. 

> Cum au aparut toate ? Din nimic nu se poate, trebuie sa existe ceva pt a se putea crea altceva.

Unu la mână, dacă e valabilă afirmația ta, de ce e excepție de la regulă dumnezeu? Doi la mână, doar pentru că nu poți concepe ceva, nu înseamnă că răspunsul e automat unul divin. Trei la mână, ai destule teorii ale începutului universului. N-ai nevoie de diplome în fizică să le înțelegi, poți fi și la nivel de amator (ca mine) să înțelegi de ce unele sunt mai probabile decât altele, de ce anumite descoperiri au invalidat unele teorii. Patru, știința, într-adevăr, vine cu teorii, unele mai probabile decât altele, dar nu are orgoliul de a spune ”asta-i explicația”, cum o fac credincioșii. Amintește-mi, orgoliul/mândia, nu era un păcat capital?

> dar tot timpul vor avea acest handicap al faptului ca nu pot sa zica cu precizie ce a fost acolo.

Deci îmi pot răspunde cu precizie la întrebările despre natura universului și a existenței niște locuitori din deșertul oriental-mijlociu de acum 2000 de ani? Ok...

> insa crestinismul prezinta un Dumnezeu care se aproprie de om si chiar ajunge pe pamant intrupat

Dovada? Așa cred și eu în Harry Potter pentru că am citit nu una, ci șapte cărți despre el. Nu ai cum să dovedești că biblia nu e o născocire mega-modificată de-a lungul timpului, fără să intri în erori logice (de ce crezi în dumnezeu? Că așa zice biblia. De ce crezi biblia? Că e scrisă de dumnezeu prin intermediari. Cine zice? Biblia. Asta-i logică circulară)

> Isaia 57:15, despre iad, Matei 25:41

Ok...? Cum am zis, când nu merge cu logică, se apelează la emoție (în speță, frică. Am de comentat și aici despre cum frica e incompatibilă cu iubirea și religiile care îți încearcă toate emoțiile pentru a te prinde în ele). La mine nu mai merge.

> Spune-i direct lui Dumnezeu sa iti ofere o dovada personala a existentei Lui pentru a putea crede.

Am făcut asta, în repetate rânduri. Fie că mă crezi sau nu, am pornit de la a fi credincios. Una din laturile familiei este destul de religioasă (cu mers în fiecare duminică la biserică, de la mic la mare), iar tranziția către ateism n-a fost peste noapte, deci ar fi avut destule ocazii să mă readucă pe drumul ”cel drept”, dacă voia/exista.

Iar prin procesul ăsta de îndoială am ajuns la concluzia că religia e răspunsul cel mai simplu/leneș pentru întrebările existențiale și/sau chiar normale ale vieții, ”e voia domnului”. Există răspunsuri la întrebări și fără a apela la supranatural, doar că e nevoie să depui mai mult efort în a le găsi, și unele necesită introspecție, lucru de care, aparent, nu e toată lumea capabilă.",0,1719834645,,,0,lb43x5f,t3_1drz63u,t1_lb3a083,1719834659,0,False,Men_RO,t5_8hv7dd

herbal_thought,,,"Watching the man or woman you love and adore suffering and dying can do some serious damage to our minds. It affects us in so many ways for the rest of our lives. More so if we are codependent on them for our happiness in life. 

But we need to try and find a way to make the pain less, to become less miserable, otherwise what is left of our life will be a wasted mess of frustrations, loneliness and depression.  

But I can recognize that raising two kids alone means you have no time or energy left over for you, or to find a way to heal or to deal with all that you are struggling with. I am in deep awe of you and your strength to continue like this for seven years and continue taking care of your kids. I have been struggling with my wife's death from her breast cancer for five years and I am without children. So I am sure you don't feel like it right now but you are in some ways incredible. But you need to find something, anything that you can do that can help you escape and repair even for short moments. 

The first few years I had used guided meditation initially to fix my insomnia but also just to find a way to reduce my misery. It sounds silly but the goal of meditation is to teach you how to focus on your breathing and in turn not notice our negative thoughts and the nervous chatter of the mind. Our mind will never shut up and will always talk crap about ourselves, so the less you hear all that crap, the easier it might be for you to heal. I had used the Headspace app mostly because I was too exhausted to go our after work and I didn't really want to be around other people. And the cost of the subscription for a year was cheaper than a therapy session. 

They also offer therapy-like session that deal with stuff like grief, lonyness, and sadness wrapped around a meditation training. Below is a sample of the grief sessions. There are thirty 15 minute sessions which you can do once or twice a day after the kids are in bed. If you think you can get some brief moments of escape or peace, try completing their grief, sadness and anxiety sessions. You might not feel better at first, in fact the grief sessions might make you feel worse, but if you keep it up, over time you might find your pain and suffering a little bit less.

Note if you can afford to or can get access to a social worker or a therapist for free please do it. It can also help in small ways.

I_reddit_like_this,,:snoo_hearteyes: Permanent Resident,"Health care here is generally good and affordable when paying out of pocket. Specialist doctors generally charge about $800 pesos for an exam and diagnostics, and medicines are also very inexpensive. Unless you have cancer or a complicated medical condition, it's usually feasible to pay for services out of pocket. However, insurance is still recommended for emergencies and future medical needs.

Private insurance is the best option. My wife and I are in our 50s, and I just renewed our policy, paying $92,000 pesos for the year with a $31,000 deductible and 10% copay per condition (no deductible for emergencies/accidents). This policy also includes $100,000 USD coverage outside of Mexico.

The next best option is IMSS, which is run by the government and can be purchased by people with residency. The level of IMSS care can vary widely from hospital to hospital; the ones in larger cities are generally better, but I've heard many horror stories about substandard care.

Seguro Popular/INSABI is the lowest level of healthcare.  It's free and available to everyone. It is a last resort for those without money

Then peri hit and multiple things collapsed. My heart developed an electrical problem and the drugs they put me on to correct it sapped me of whatever remaining energy I had. I could barely peel myself out of bed to sit in my home office chair. I atrophied from being sedentary for months. All of my muscles weakened while my tendons and ligaments got overstretched. We thought it might be EDS (it’s not). 

After a surgery on the heart, my right arm and shoulder were so painful that it’d wake me up multiple times a night in agony. PT for six months didn’t touch it so ortho did a rotator cuff repair and severed/reattached my bicep. Every provider told me “this happens sometimes to ‘women of a certain age.’” I was 46. I never thought 46 was that age. This is in addition to watching my face fall one side at a time while my brain function tanked - I legit thought I’d had a stroke or was getting dementia. The depression and anxiety dialed to 11. I could no longer function at work - I would cry and be emotional in front of colleagues and then curl up into a fetal position under my desk and weep between meetings (fortunately work from home). I had to quit and was told that I’d made a commitment to complete a mission and was letting the team down. I was wrecked. 

I’m now six months from surgery and two months unemployed - the surgery was excruciating, recovery has been torturous, the pain meds jacked my gastrointestinal tract so I ended up hospitalized with diverticulitis (while in an immobilization brace for my arm). Post-surgery PT was the bad kind of pain but I was told to push through, so I developed frozen shoulder for months. I’m finally at a point where I can use the arm again, but the pain never stopped. I’m in Pilates again now which gives the good kind of pain and have been doing acupuncture and tui na all along, but it has been a long hard slog. 

I am so grateful to younger me for being the type to save for a rainy day and to be in an affluent area with great healthcare. My heart weeps for so many other women who can’t get access to resources. My mother died at 44. Her mother at 48. Both due to colon cancer that spread like wildfire.

RaspberryUnited9501,,,"thank you for your reply and sympathy :) i am sorry for your loss as well. i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your mother at such a young age and grow up without your mother, also i cant believe how hard it would be to lose your life long partner and navigate single parenting.

i realize i didnt provide much background, my mom had cancer for 6? years (she was a fighter for sure). i am an incoming second year university student, so i am living with my dad and brother for the summer. i didnt make it back home in time to see my mom for the last time since im at school 4 hours away. i just think back to the moment where my dad called me asking me to come home to visit my mom a day before she passed and i said that i had an exam the next day and i'd come the day after, since we thought we'd have more time with her. i dont know why i didnt see the signs (my mom asking me to buy an oxygen tracker for her, my dad picking up my calls when im calling my mom, etc).

to be honest, i can see signs of my dad being overwhelmed - all the paperwork that comes with death, work, appointments, etc. that alone i know is a whole lot, and on top of that, parenting. whenever i try talking to my dad about my mom or my feelings, i feel like he just brushes it off or doesnt want to talk about it. there is this one time where we went to lunch with one of my dads friends, and he asked my dad if hes gonna find a girlfriend anytime soon, and he responded maybe after im finished schooling. i just wanted to cry the whole time we were having lunch. i expressed this to my dad afterwards and he said nothing is going to happen and his friend doesnt mean any harm, and said can we not talk about this right now. there was another time where he called my grandpa to talk to me about my feelings (i am not that close with my grandpa). honestly, after these moments and other moments similar it became hard to bring this stuff up with him. i feel like he doesnt know how to handle these conversations and it really sucks (and even though its not the case, it feels like he doesnt want to try). despite this, ill try to talk to him again about things i mentioned and see how it goes.

i do feel like i have taken on some of the role of my mom for the time ive been home since i have the most time on my hands - cleaning the house, cooking meals that she used to cook. my dad has as well, making meals, gardening, and doing some cleaning. i remember my mom talking about how she was concerned about my dads ability to take care of me and my brother alone since before her death he didnt really tend to much things at home (mostly just work), and honestly i can now see and experience her concerns. 

i do have some friends and some of my close cousins that i talk to about my concerns, and they just seem more understanding and willing to talk about things, even if they dont know what to say - the important thing is that they dont just brush off or ridicule what i say to be such a minor problem. another thing is that me and my dad do have some sort of a language barrier - he mostly speaks chinese, and while i speak chinese as well, it can be hard sometimes to fluently communicate my feelings. 

all this to say is that, i know single parenting is hard and i do have sympathy for my dad, and ill try to talk to him about my concerns again. again, thank you for your reply and insight it does mean a lot :)",0,1719837665,,,0,lb4a5q7,t3_1dslxx8,t1_lb3onwa,1719837681,2,False,cancer,t5_2qixx
Pro_Responsibility2,,Pro-life except rape and life threats,">A physician practicing to the standard of care would be able to evaluate if the treatment is necessary, and additionally would be able to evaluate if your child might be at risk from harm from you if you are seeking unnecessary treatment. Who do you think is most qualified to determine if treatment for cancer is needed?

Right so they would evaluate if the pregnancy is a medical life risk under the guidelines that they have and if it meets the criteria they would recommend and be allowed to perform an abortion. Seems super fair.

hahahaxyz123,,,"It’s absolutely crazy to talk about these things in the context of comparing it to a place where you will get **killed**.

Marriage is just a social construct, quite a religious one even, so for non religious people, the only use for marriage is tax breaks. So why not instead argue that everyone has to pay the same taxes without giving a privilege  to married people? Give tax privileges to people who raise children, and base it only on children. There’s no other point, why would you want the government to know who you love and have it in a database? What horrible idea to conflict love and relationships with bureaucracy and government. The issue is meaningless, especially compared to **not being murdered**

Then „trans healthcare“, well we both know that both trans and not trans people will get the exact same healthcare. Break an arm, you will get the same treatment. 

So it’s not about healthcare in general, or getting the same healthcare. It’s instead about giving trans people a **special privilege** to some special care that **no one else feel entitled to**, but then you **invert** it, basically saying **unless you give those peopling like special treatment, you are denying them healthcare**

Which is just such an incredibly dishonest statement. You are saying that they are not getting a specific surgery or medications to change the physical appearance to look more like the other sex. But when you say that trans people don’t get healthcare, **you make it sound like they break their arm, or get cancer, and will not get treated because the hospital found out that the patient is trans, so they get thrown out of the hospital**

roymondous,vegan,vegan,">The individual does matter. 

>Whatever benefits the majority of individuals is the best decision. 

Right. So the individual doesn't matter. In and of themselves. In utilitarian philosophy. You can harm the individual if there's benefit to others. In the actual example I gave you, the individual didn't matter. You mixed them up. You shooting a deer does not stop an additional deer being predated as you initially said. 

>Population control heavily benefits the herd, and every animal given a good death benefits in that way.

""A good death"". Again, wonder if they'd think that. Or if they'd prefer to live, be with their babies, and be with their herd for longer. You are describing this in such weird ways. 

>Dominant males of herds (for deer in this scenario) rarely chase after predators unless they're cornered or too tired to run any more. Even if they did try to protect the herd, they're at a huge risk of injury or death themselves, so there's no difference. The protection is in the numbers of the herd, not an individual trying to protect it.

More assumptions. You clearly haven't researched the topic, as shown by your ignorance of just how much hunting contributed, among other issues. I don't care about your opinion. It does not matter in this discussion. 

>Option 1: 99% of wild animals die horrible deaths, but maybe some live a little bit longer.

Again, random numbers pulled out your ass. Please do a bit of research before making claims about who you can kill. You are assuming you have the moral right to decide who lives and dies - against the will of that animal (yes, comparisons to humans are valid). You require VER Ygood arguments to morally justify yourself in saying 'I have the moral right to kill you for your own benefit even if you don't want it'. 

>Option 2: Animals killed by hunters get to die a good death but die a little bit sooner. The others continue to die horrible deaths that they were *already guaranteed*. Maybe they die a bit sooner too, it really doesn't make much of a difference.

A ""good death"" is a bunch of bullshit. Again, 

>We euthanize animals all the time, our pets. We make the best compassionate decision with the options we have. It just so happens that the most compassionate and realistic option for wild animals is a bullet instead of a medication.

It doesn't ""just so happen"". We aren't talking of a pet with cancer or something that means they will be suffering every moment. We are talking of a deer in it's prime, with young to care for, as part of a herd, and with happy and sad and joyous and painful moments. Most of all, an animal that does not want to die.

It is your opinion based on nothing at all. You've given random numbers and no actual data or evidence. 99% of statistics are made up.

I am a published author, I mean I am no James Patterson, Stephen King etc and really it's not the purpose of me writing but I make fun money off my book sales. In a given month I am in the green by $100-300 dollars on a new book depending on the book genre and season when first published. I don't really even do it for the money, like I said. I have a fulltime job and do plenty of other gigs as a performer slash artist on the side because it makes me happy. Artistic expression just makes my world brighter and helps me from falling into bad mental health cycles as I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD, or what I like to call, the Holy Bullsh*ttery, blessed be it's name. 

I started writing as a kid because I am dyslexic - highly - like ever see a person when you spell a weirdly spelt word and they look like they want to jump into oncoming traffic? I'm worse. Don't give me verbal directions FFS text it. Point. Anything. The second my mental word is required to need to know too many words at any given time, I panic. I have tried every class, app, TikTok lifehack...its not my strength. I am good at other things like coding or planning events etc. I have other strengths. So I just do my best and keep swimming like a dyslexic Dory. 

THAT SAID I was teased and bullied relentlessly all through childhood a lot growing up and labeled the dunce so the trauma lives. 

For an example, I was in my local paper - small town - for an event at school. I was like 2nd grade at the oldest. I made a whole imaginary town out of recycled materials and and had a story with it as my end of year project. I worked on it for literal months, even figuring out how to make it foldable so it easier to travel with it in my grandfathers minivan. My story had 10 chapters and was handwritten in my messy kid handwriting. I had a teacher Ms. Smith. That's her real name because F that woman and it's common enough. She said my project was low class but ""I guess I shouldn't expect much from you"" and she walked off. Her son, my classmate, stomped my project to oblivion. He smashed my playdough figurines of the people and pets, and as if that was not enough, he pointed and laughed at me when I cried. He then put copies of the article with my picture but added a dunce had and laughing faces in the school - lunchroom, homeroom, etc. I mean the guy could cure cancer if he used that determination on it, I will give him that. If you're reading this Tyler - F you in particular and may your socks always be just a *little* damp. 

I was unlucky enough that when I moved, Tylers mom happen to as well, so guess who had the privilege of that gem's company for 3 grades? Tyler shoved me lockers in the 4th grade. He called me dumb every day. In 5th grade I was called dumb and fat (I was an underweight child). 

So fast forward and I am now in my early 30s, still dyslexic as hell. I live in a different state. I have a life and learned ways to deal with my weird brain and function. I moved on from childhood trauma, therapy, etc etc... 

There is a guy I liked, Brian, and Brian seemed to like me too so we decided to do ""non-date causal hangouts"" to see if we vibe enough to consider dating (his words and idea). We hung out one on one for several instances but once he was super late so I had my laptop out. He saw me when he arrived and asked what I was doing and I sheepishly responded I was working on my next book. He inquired more and I told him I published my first when I was 17 and have published at least 1 every year since then and told him of Ms. Smith and Tyler and more horror stories I won't get into as this is now a novel itself lol but that it spurred me to prove them wrong and beat this weird stereotype that neurodivergent folk are dumb, etc. He asked to read it, and I said no. I use a pen name on purpose as those Amazon reviews can make you want to yeet your own soul from your body so I keep it separate from everyday life. 

Well, turns out if you know me and my nerdy joys, my pen name is easy to guess. From there its easy to *find* because I mentioned Amazon and let's just say my bio makes it pretty clear. At our next meetup he asked me if I was said author and my shocked Pikachu face told him everything so he started reading the series. He came back the next time we met to laugh and say ""I see why you don't put your name on your works. Don't quit your day job. Your writing sucks."" and he placed a copy of one of my books down on the bar. 

I couldn't help but drop my shoulders. He was laughing and talking, not seeing my expression and kept saying how he wasted hours of his life and FFS someone take my laptop as it might be a lethal weapon meant to kill us all with boredom. 

Turns out he's not into mysteries or fantasy. I said that maybe it's just not his genre and he said it wasn't but ""an [R-word] 3rd grader could have done better"" and it's a good thing I am good at my job. It was then that I could see he actually took in my expression and he backtracked. ""I mean you clearly don't do it for money so it's whatever right? "" and said I have other strengths but he did not believe at all that I make money off this. He asserting surely, I buy my good reviews and probably bulk buy my own books to improve sales. I don't do any of that. 

I just smiled it away and said ""well, I can't please everyone but I did make 250 this month from the sales of my last book alone so some people must like it"" and laughed it off. But I knew then and there I didn't want to pursue him anymore. When he texted to see if I planned our next hang out, I was honest and texted back that I wasn't interested and said that while I can take a note or any criticism, the way he went about it was hurtful and I don't want to be with someone who treats me that way for a hobby, that we are different people but I would like to remain friends, as otherwise we get on well, but nothing more. 

He went off on me saying I picked the wrong time to lash out as he was having a bad day and now I've made it worse and that I am so rude and petty to be mad at honest criticism. He said that if I am so sensitive over honest opinions, good luck finding anyone who would want my dumb🍑 since looks are all I have with makeup and work and ""nothing between the ears"" 

I blocked him but we have a mutual friend group and almost all of them have been asking me what's going on and that I broke his heart. I was thinking *what*? *How*? They said he's been depressed and asking about me and figured out I blocked him on everything and wants to give me a birthday gift (my birthday party past last week and I didn't invite him). My friends are saying we are adults and this is immature.  I mean I am not a saint and I have toxic traits too, but I don't want to be with someone who criticizes me and my work that way and treats me like bantha poodoo. Am I crazy? Am I TAH? 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/1OrGaLGdUj)  **May 5, 2024** 

Hi - so for anyone who cares to know, Brian told all our friends that I rubbed my achievements in his face and called him an idiot (I never said anything like that). He told them also about my post so he found it somehow and started telling everyone that I am trying to slander him as ""girls can ruin a man's reputation by snapping her fingers"" and suggested my next move would be to say he assaulted me. 

Some of our friends came at me hard saying I was bullying him and trying to ruin his rep and all he did was asking a girl he liked out for drinks and that I need to apologize and just suck it up and go to drinks with him. They since have either outright not invited me out with the group or disinvited me to events and it was really hard to accept. 

I was realy confused, because he was the one who made fun of me and I wrestled with myself going over every talk again and again wondering if I inadvertently said or did something to upset him. It wasn't until I checked our text and message history that it occurred to me to send the screenshots as he called me a moron and then when I rejected him he called me fat, desperate, and stupid. And there were more such messages after he found my book series. So I took screenshots and sent it to my friends and they were shocked. 

Apparently according to Brian my outwardly ""sweet demeanor"" hides my judgemental and cruel side and that I strung him along anf called him a loser when I told him I wasn't interested in dating him. I even pettily went back before all of this and screenshot spme of his rude or mean texts he made. And I screenshot my actual rejection text and his response and sent that along as well. 

Now the tides have shifted and most of our friends think he was the AH and 2 of our friends are saying I am sending ""my choice"" of screenshots to make him out to be a villain and that they have seen the ""real"" screenshots of me bullying him. I asked them to produce such screenshots but they refused and said I wouldn't be worried about them if I was innocent as some sort of ""gotcha"". 

I feel really bad as I wanted to stay friendly but I can never look at him with any semblance of respect anymore. I am glad it's cleared up with my friends (sans the 2 holdouts but they are now also on the outs with the group) so things are looking back to normal. I have my first publishing party for my next book and everyone is invited but them. 

Weird way it all ended but oh well.

So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father’s situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister’s college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn’t have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn’t happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn’t respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she’s “poor” and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop “holding her tuition over her head”. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever “pay me back” nor have I ever “held it over her head”. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn’t realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she’s still young. She once again didn’t reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It’s a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn’t replying to my texts and I’m just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn’t from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

Over the course of two years, right after I was getting my life in good shape after cancer and becoming interesting to women, I was sexually harassed by a diversity hire who didn't do any work, falsely accused of breaking into a sorority girl's home as her way of retaliating for telling her I thought she was manipulative and I didn't trust her enough to go to her house (I still have no idea where it is or was), which included a literal fake crime scene and report to the police, and finally targeted by a psychopath who used feminism to get positions of power from which she could prey on others in cons and scams via a rumor campaign that cost me scholarships, employment positions, the esteem of someone I cared deeply for, tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly got me kicked out of school. I have a PTSD diagnosis from this and suffer from extremely bad hypervigilance related to social interaction as a result. I am terrified of other human beings now.


Feminists have used me for sex while feigning friendship, promised me honesty and help with my high-functioning autism while lying and manipulating me, spread untrue rumors alleging I'm schizophrenic after I trusted them with knowledge of my disability (definitely not, no symptoms, currently receiving mental health care and my provider has confirmed my reasoning and perceptions are sound), denied me the opportunity to speak in my own defense, gaslit me, offered help and withdrawn it, body shamed me about a million different times, emotionally abused me, told me I was dangerous for reporting attempts of others to hurt me, lied about my behavior in the pursuit of petty grudges, encouraged dangerous women to girlboss by destroying other people, punished me for reporting literal crimes, and discouraged friends from listening when I was suffering and desperately needed someone to talk to.


Feminist books are great. The PR is wonderful. Feminist people treat men like shit. The best of you are apathetic. The worst of you are vampires for whom the ability to hurt men is a perk. There is zero policing against abusive women who use the movement as a source of justifications for hurting others, you simply deny it ever happens instead.


Women who are dangerous people target those who are vulnerable who others will not believe or care about if they report wrongdoing.

Individual_Crazy1494,,,"Please hang on, jonm61! I'm beyond sorry that your furry companion will soon be leaving you. But there's still life & hope for you here.


While your post doesn’t go into details on what's going to happen to your beloved ""soul dog"" or if you have family, friends, or a support network, I gotta believe there's somebody in this world who cares about you, the pain you're feeling & what you're going through. Even though your post leaves much unsaid, I want you to know that I care about you & your feelings about losing your beloved pup on July 3rd. Most importantly, your post seemed to mention another dog that you have (""she's 11"") that still needs & cares about you. I also believe others here on this Reddit post care too.


Like you, I'm single, no kids, in pain (some emotional, but mostly from age & a thyroid that decided to go kablooey a few years ago). But my faith along with my furry family—a rascally 9-year-old pup I adopted from my local animal shelter & 7(!) mischievous cats (please, no""crazy cat lady"" jokes)—help me find joy each day, even during tough times.


I understand the indescribable pain of losing a furry family member. Before my current little  monkeys, I had a gentle & sweet little furry pup who was my best friend. He passed away from cancer in 2013 after enduring multiple surgeries & chemo. Mercifully, he passed away in my arms, sparing me the gut-wrenching decision to euthanize him (it was scheduled). It's been over 10 years, but my love & thoughts of him remain just as strong.


Recently, on May 31st, I lost my little 'OG' angel cat, also to cancer. She was almost 13. I'm trying not to cry now as I remember the light slowly leaving her beautiful eyes, as she too passed away in my arms, a mere hour before the vet was due at my home to euthanize her. The pain from losing them both is heavy, but I'm grateful for the family, friends, and people who care about me. And most importantly, my furry babies who unconditionally love & need me.


To help cope with the loss & begin healing, I started volunteering at my local animal shelter back in 2013. That’s how I ended up becoming a 'foster failure' & adopted my current pup in late 2014. The uncomplicated,  unconditional love, faithfulness & simple companionship of our furry babies is hard to explain to people who haven't experienced it & just don't know.


But I understand, and I care. Jonm61 please hang on; reach out for help when/if you need it, be gentle with yourself, and after July 3rd, please try to hold onto all the wonderful memories of the good times & love you shared with your beloved ""soul dog.""",0,1719813525,,,0,lb389ox,t3_1drq0gk,t1_laxoj65,1719813540,2,False,Veterans,t5_2rc75

Now it’s in general life, learning what superficial people are, learning that I’ve been manipulated, me not being able to trust people, people only wanting my body or like having me around because of my appearance.

Always being talked over and cut short of my goals, and my dreams were crushed early on because my boss in my big girl job can’t stop commenting about my chest or ass or anything sexual at all so I don’t enjoy it anymore.

Cardio-fast-eatass,,,"I think when we look at utilitarianism as just costs of treatment, it waters down the argument.
More specifically I was curious if there was another philosophy to the division of treatments to those requiring them. Utilitarianism will dictate that those that are easier to treat (and therefore cheaper) should take priority over those that are more complicated. What it doesn’t usually take into account is why these people required treatments in the first place. Say for example an individual was partaking in extremely risky behaviour with a high chance of serious injury, or if somebody suffers a heart attack due to lifelong obesity, or if somebody develops lung cancer due to years or smoking, or somebody requires regular medical care due only to old age. Utilitarianism will treat all of these people equally as long as treatment is obtainable, however, this comes at a cost to those that might require extensive treatments due to no fault of their own.

Utilitarianism aims to create the most amount of “good” and “happiness” in the world, which it seems to do. It doesn’t, to me at least, seem morally fair. There are instances when utilitarianism will hurt a few for the benefit of the much greater.

The guy runs by the name of Dexter Holland. 

He’s the lead singer of a band called the Offspring. 

His PhD thesis is titled ""Discovery of mature microRNA sequences within the protein-coding regions of global HIV-1 genomes: predictions of novel mechanisms for viral infection and pathogenicity""

They played their biggest headlining show of their careers in Chicago last year, on the same tour where, after fees NYC pit tickets went for $380+ USD. Before that wildly successful US tour they had sold out their Canada tour with Simple Plan, their Australia tour with Sum41 and their entire European headlining tour. 

He’s been a volunteer since forever for Angle Flight where he offers his time and jet and flies people like little kids with cancer for life critical treatment for free, thus as someone who works with these very ill and immuno compromised patients he was eligible for the mRNA vaccine in the fist round and he got it in January to be able to fly these unfortunate ill folks.

GlitteringYams,,⭐,"Oh you can absolutely fuck right off. This is such a cold, calloused response, it's mind boggling. Like I'm absolutely livid. You literally care more about the comfort of the parents than the wellbeing of OOP. This isn't about the parents, that baby isn't theirs. They're not obligated to pay a fucking dime or waste a second of their time on that baby. They could disown OOP if they wanted to, plenty of parents kick out their pregnant daughters, it isn't exactly uncommon. 

The idea of taking a newborn baby away from another who loves it and wants it is so horrific to me that I can barely stomach it. And you think it's an appropriate way to teach a child that actions have consequences? 

I can, on some level, understand the concern. Being a single mom is *hard*. You know what else is hard? Losing a child. What do you think is going to happen after OOP gives birth? Do you think she'll just... Snap back to the way she was before? Nothing is every going to be the same after she gives birth. She's going to experience pain for weeks as her uterus returns to its normal size. She may suffer from post partum depression. Hell, how do you think she's going to feel when she pumps, then has to dump out all the milk because there isn't a baby to give it to? Do you think that shit isn't going to affect her psyche?

How do you think a mother feels when she miscarries or delivers a stillborn? How do you think a mother feels when she finds out that cord wrapped around the baby's throat and strangled it in delivery? How she feels when she finds out her preemie didn't make it? When she walks into the nursery to discover that her baby has died of SIDS? When OOP gives up that baby, it will be gone from her life forever. She will never see it again. She will never get to raise it, never get to see it's first steps or hear it's first words, there will never be Christmases or mother's days, or 4 of Julys. No lullabies, no little babies shoes, no nothing. Do you think that her grief will be any less real, any less tangible? Do you really think that the memory of the baby won't haunt her forever? Sure, she knows she has to give it up, but do you really think that will make it any easier or less traumatic? Knowing the inevitable doesn't make things less painful. Mothers who lose children to terminal cancer aren't somehow less traumatized than mothers who lose their babies in car crashes. 

OOP's parents don't want to raise the baby? Great, they don't have to. They can put their foot down, they can set boundaries, they can evict her. If she *chooses* to keep the baby, they can *choose* to do whatever the hell they want if they don't want anything to do with it. 

But they do not have the right to make the choice to keep the baby. It isn't their decision to make. They *cannot* force her to give birth, let her become attached and fall in love with the child, then force her to give it away when she loves it and wants it. That's despicable. They cannot strip her of that choice. Everybody's so worried that she's going to raise the baby and regret it. What if she gives the baby away and regrets it? What if she gives the baby away and it alters the trajectory of the rest of her life? 

Just because she's young, doesn't mean that she isn't a person. It's her body, her baby. We shouldn't be focusing on how *inconvenient* this might be for the parents. Their signature isn't the one on the paper. They're forcing her to pick which family is going to take her baby away. Literally the idea of how that must feel makes me nauseated.

Staying down and working through ground balls, you don't have the luxury to sit back and wait for them to come to you.

I know I'm next. The gut wrenching nausea deep within me... It's growing... Fast... All my memories and regrets... They become increasingly heavy. It's a burden that is almost too much to bear. I now understand why Marcoh succumbed to the madness. It truly is a fate worse than death.”*

Judement is a manifestation of Tanaka's regrets, his character arc throughout the festival has made it more obvious how much of his life he’s wasted during something that he didn’t enjoy. This makes it clear that 1) even if a moonscorhed victim's dialogue sounds happy, they’re likely not, and analyzing the symbolism is more important. And 2) that moonscorhing is a fate worse than death.


Marcoh becomes the giant. Daan's medical diagnosis skill explains that the harden body is formed like cancer tissue. Maroch's guilt from having murdered someone, manifested like cancer eating him from the inside. The giant holds a man in his hand, who he either pounds in the floor, or throws at the player, showing Maroch's fear of how easily he can use his larger body to bully others.


Henryk becomes the Gentleman, which shows Henryk's insecurities as a failed artist. Henryk says that views his cooking as his art. Since we know his artist career went nowhere, it's likely that he tries to maintain some artistic craft in his food to keep himself content with his life. However the fact that the Gentleman's “food” is sexual and meaningless implies that he doubts this “artistic food” talk deep down. It might seem like the Gentleman oblivious to how disgusting the ""food"" is from his dialogue, however if we think about Judgment and Tanaka's notes, it’s likely that the Gentleman is the same type of case. The Gentleman may say that he’s a artistic man, but it actually shows that Henryk is self conscious about his art, food and possibly the fact he's 32 and single. Given he kidnaps Marina and the sexual “food”


Caligura becomes Monster, which symbolizes his need to be and feel above others, and the insecurities as to why. It’s due his fear of being seen his little (shown by the Monster's dialogue if you use persuade on it) likely because of some past trauma. He clearly cares about his appearance, his white suit would be harder to keep clean, and his hair is well groomed. (He feels disgusted by his appearance shown by the warts covering Monster's body, and the sexual appearance of them shows to me that deep down he knows his actions are self destructive) He’s also clearly paranoid, seen by his Interaction with Marcoh. That fact Caligura moonscorched in the sewer is likely because when he was traveling through it, it made him feel extra disgusting, little, paranoid, and below others both physically and mentally.


Olivia becomes the Mechanical Dance. Olivia likes to be one with nature, but she fears that her wheelchair makes her half human, half machine. When the mechanical dance “vents out,” it looks like she’s breathing through where her wheelchair used to be, symbolizing her shame that she has to rely on it as much as she does. (There’s also some possible implications to her being overshadowed by Relia, but that’s not the primary insecurity behind the Mechanical Dance)


Karin becomes the Valkyrie. The Valkyrie symbolizes her guilt of the fact she profits from the suffering of others as a journalist, fearing she’s no better than the corrupt authorities she’s constantly criticizing. While the form is called Valkyrie, it looks more like a vulture, symbolizing her cognitive dissonance, and the fear she’s actually a vulture masquerading as a just Valkyrie. There’s armor plating covering her eyes, likely showing her feeling like she has to blind herself from the truth of her profession.


Marina becomes the Cocoon, which symbolizes her fear of being a puppet of her father. While Marina didn’t become a dark priest, she still ended up becoming on occultist, which is pretty similar. She also went back to Prehevil because of a letter her father sent. Her original head has become a carrier for a phallic looking cocoon, and a new head has grown between her legs, symbolizing her gender dysphoria and her fear of going down the path her father wanted to follow unintentionally.


Samarie becomes Dysmorphia, which is named after body dysmorphia. Body dysmorphia usually means the person suffering from it perceives their body in a exaggerated negative way, that doesn’t reflect how the actually look for everyone else. Dysmorphia's head being split open is symbolic of how Samarie's “radiant soul needs” are being suppressed by her self loathing. Every time she tries initiating a conversation with Marina or father Domek, she almost immediately loses confidence. Dysmorphia's head is spilt open also shows the pain that she feels when others observe her body and face, thinking they’re judging her every move. Dysmorphia dialogue sounds confident, but it comes off as desperate and contrasts the appearance greatly, similar to Judgement. The peeled open head is also similar in appearance to the janitor's back and Logic's hair, and she describes herself as: *“Like a moth! I'm finally close to bloom! A hairy moth in the night!“* Moths are connected to Logic, which likely hints to her past of forcefully being connected to the old gods. The armored body of Dysmorphia, is likely also symbolic of her scared body from her time in the ninth circle of Fiend Petr's Basilica.",0,1719816000,,,0,lb3c1nu,t3_1dscv1e,t3_1dscv1e,1719816016,1,False,FearAndHunger,t5_uoe16

bulbasauuuur,,,"Well I’m glad to hear he’s getting treatment. That early in treatment is still tough though. 

The issue is being gentle isn’t really what is best for either of you. Being assertive about how you feel is still important, and you can be understanding without babying him. I would think more it’s just like messages saying you’re thinking of him and hope he’s doing well without the expectation of a reply. This is assuming you communicate other ways besides text, too. Texting might be harder than other ways. If this texting is the only way you communicate, the issue would be a lot different.

A lot of people are jumping to weird conclusions about cheating and that he doesn’t care about you. They literally know nothing about him except a couple of texts, so don’t listen to all that since you know your relationship far better.

I also saw you say he tries to appease his dad because of how his dad treated him growing up. I honestly relate a lot with your boyfriend, except I’m a woman and it was with my mom, and I even had times where my depression was too overwhelming to talk to the people I loved most.  Does he have a plan to move out of his dad’s house? I’ve been in treatment for my mental illnesses for nearly 2 decades now but nothing improved my life as much as moving out of my mom’s house did. I highly encourage he take that step sooner rather than later. I assume money is an issue, but seriously, it’s worth figuring it out. It’s worth it to have a less comfortable physical space and not have the mental strain of a parent like that. It is freeing in a way I never could’ve imagined. I’d rather eat nothing but ramen noodles because that’s all I can afford than live with my mom again. 

The thing about a relationship is it can’t always be 50/50. Sometimes one person will need more support and can’t offer support. Sometimes it will switch. As long as the overall balance feels 50/50 then it still is fair. I really appreciate the people in my life that stuck with me through my worst periods of depression. Now that I’m able, I support them, help them, and am active in maintaining the relationships. I know how it can feel bad for the person who is trying to stick with someone with a mental illness and how it can feel like they don’t care about you at times, though. I know how my depression hurt people in my life too. But really, if someone was sick with cancer or something, no one would expect they’d be up for texting constantly. Bipolar disorder can be deadly and just as draining. 

So yeah, I guess I would say your feelings definitely do matter but I would consider the overall relationship more than this one incident. Consider if he put in effort when he could other times, or try to get through this now and see how his behavior is as he starts recovery

She got him through rehab (which was rare in the late 70's), he let her have full control over his finances, they did not even live together at that point. When he finally had his shit together and moved in a few years into their relationship, he proposed to her but not in a romantic way - her doing jobs left and right whereever she could make some money and taking care of the kids she had no savings or anything prepared for rent in any sort, he already helped with utility bills (at least she got the house from my gramps attested to her by court - who was by then a wealthy lawyer but otherwise wouldnt give her a penny, maybe buy the kids some clothes at times)

He did love her but could never find the words for it as he did not experience love for the first 35 years of his life, which were miserable. So he proposed to her calling it ""securing her"", saving taxes, less paperwork, etc. She said she is not going to accept a proposal under these aspects.

The sort of man, who'll put you in a hole financially with no remorse! A ""nice guy"", who only does the barest minimum around the house to complete a transaction for sex! Now he's using his ASD diagnosis as a deflective shield to excuse even more flagrantly disrespectful behavior, on purpose! When are you going to get angry on your own behalf and decide that you deserve better than to be treated like a single mother in a married household and a hole for him to fuck? Jesus, the vast majority of autistic people beat themselves up for the most minor social faux pas, and here this guy is, treating you not as a person he loves, but as a wife appliance, who isn't putting out enough for his liking. Are you kidding me? No diagnosis is going to excuse this man's actions. Stop trying to find excuses that removes his agency in what he's doing to you and own the fact that he's acting like this, because he can and likes it. He doesn't care about you. He cares about what you do for him. Your feelings, your boundaries, your agency and worth as a person comes second to whatever he wants, and he'll assert control in any way he can, to keep making you feeling small and guilty for not ""doing enough"" to please him. Don't fall for the bullshit coming out of his mouth, and look at his actions. Are you going to waste more time being treated like this, and join the statistic of married women dying younger than single women, while your husband joins the one of married men living longer than single ones? Why the fuck are you wasting your love on someone, who doesn't even give a fraction of that energy in return? Why would you fuck a man you're basically raising like a dependent? Quit burning yourself out for the sake of someone, who'll absolutely leave you, if you ever come down with burnout, cancer, or a crippling injury. You may love him, but Jesus, woman, take a page out of this man's book, and love yourself more.

Past-Reading1157,,,"It would be helpful if you would say what city and country you live in. Many people here would be willing to help you look for resources that may be available to help your dog.  Do not shave your dogs fur- the fur doesn’t “take” nutrients- in fact a body will naturally let hair and skin suffer and go without in order to provide nutrients to systems that are critical to staying alive- like the heart, lungs and digestive system. Shaving its fur will only make it vulnerable- you said it is hot there- many dogs have double coats specifically to insulate them from cold AND heat and shaving them will make them unable to regulate their body temperature. 

Your dog may have something as minor as parasites or as serious as cancer- but it absolutely must have veterinary treatment or it will almost definitely die. Again, if you tell us where you live, people will help you find a way to treat the dog. 

Veterinary treatment costs money, because like doctors, vets have to go to medical school, and it takes years of training and a lot of money. What your parents may think is extortion is simply the cost it takes to get that training couple with what it takes to run a business and profit enough to survive most likely. And vets are not psychic- they cannot tell what is wrong with an animal without doing tests- they can only guess. 

People in many countries will go into debt in order to provide their dogs with medical care, so it is difficult to hear that your parents, who are not even struggling financially, simply do not want to use their money to help this dog. I understand there are probably cultural differences, but it is obvious that YOU love the dog so clearly caring enough to spend money on an animal isn’t entirely unheard of there.

Upstairs-Aerie-4909,,Historical Legend,"Hi again John/MrBallen

We're coming to see you in Dallas!!

My sister and I will be there to see you start your tour! 😃👏 

When you first announced your tour,  I went on the link and had the Meet and Greet tickets in my cart.  But, when I clicked to purchase them, the screen refreshed and said that they'd sold.  Which was a total bummer. 

But! It takes more then that to get me down  :)

I was able to secure a couple really great presale seats thanks to your Ballen code.   Thank you!   We're looking forward to seeing/hearing you tell your stories in person!!  :)

I'll be able to combine coming to see you with visiting with mom as she continues to fight her cancer.  She wasn't up for coming due to her chemo, but looks forward to being there vicariously.

Regarding our previous communication about Dad, I realized that I'd neglected to tell you what Dad appreciated most about you and your story telling. 

He greatly admired your service as a Navy SEAL.   And as I said previosly, he loved learning more about Clint Eastwood/Samson and his time in the military and Fort Ord, plane crash etc through your expert story telling. 

While in college Dad was in the ROTC and went in as an Officer after college.  He was stationed in Japan and Germany during Vietnam and ultimately returned to the states to serve as Company Commander at the Defense Language Institute a few miles from Fort Ord.  After a total of 19 years of service in the Army he was honorably discharged as a Captain. 

After his Military time,  he went on to have his 38 year career with Pebble Beach Company where he worked with/for Clint Eastwood.

Dad is now at the Veterans Cemetary in Seaside,  California along with Michael, who passed at 25 months.   The Cemetary is about 5 minutes from where I live and I'm grateful they're nearby. 

If you ultimately plan to tour on the West Coast,  specifically Monterey Bay area or anywhere in California,  I'll be one of the first to buy a Meet and Greet ticket.  And meet you in person then 🤞:)

I loved watching your documentary!  So well done!  It was so great to see how much your family, your wife and your kids have supported you in your journey.  :)  

Even though it's a very different topic,  it reminded me of a documentary short I wrote and produced in college and the short film I wrote/reintepreted and co-produced with a couple friends a few years later. :)

Please tell your family and team that you all nailed it! Full on nailed it with Becoming Mr Ballen! Well done! 👏

Thank you again for your honest transparency about your mental health and sobriety challenges.  And your kind words,  condolences and prayers for me and my family.   I'm sending the same to you and yours too!  And for safe travels for all on your tour team.  

Again, you are an inspiration and have helped so many people be honest and transparent with themselves and improve their own lives and the lives of the people they love :)


I believe in you in your sobriety, mental health and your continued work!  


And yes, you can and will survive a month on a tour bus! :)

Thank you for being you and for all you do.   I look forward to seeing you in person soon in Dallas :)

faithandhope97,,,"Hi! I can relate to what you're going through. I'm 26 and just lost my mom at 57 last week to lung cancer. She was my best friend and it hurts when I want to share something with her and realise that she isn’t there anymore. Even I find myself dwelling on what could have been and what I should have done differently, but I'm starting to realize that's just part of life. 

Perhaps your mom wouldn't have wanted you to see her in the hospital. It's a difficult memory to carry. I'm struggling too, especially after seeing her uncomfortable there. But those hospital days were just a small part of her very full life. She must have had so many happy moments, especially with you. You were there for her through thick and thin, and that's what truly matters. You stayed in the same house as her!!! Which is something a lot of parents long for. You gave your mom the best care possible and your mom knew you had your reasons. Don’t beat yourself up about it. 

Gather all your photos, cherish those cute texts, and honor her memory. While it's unfair and painful, it always could have been even worse. We can be grateful she's no longer suffering.

No_Use1529,,,"Going to add this. I had the chance to let my ex die or seriously end up hurt several times.  Heck she’d have killed herself  intentionally a couple times if I let her…. Stab, shoot herself or OD take your pick. I went through it all. 

Technically tried  to stab  me, shoot me and kill us both in her car before I refused to ever get in a vehicle with her again.  The if she couldn’t have me no one could. I got told that several times.

It was a sick twisted nightmare. I wanted off the damn ride from hell so  badly. Times I thought I was going to die on it, to never escape her.

She was using something intentionally to induce extreme breathing issues. Obviously inhaling something. She brought it on as quick as she went into bathroom and coming out not even a minute later it seemed. Barely making it to the front door as I was trying to walk out that same door and collapsing at my feet. This wasn’t a fake it. It was real and serious medical duress ….

It was a form of her using it to control me and get me to stay, get her help and be by her side instead of finally leaving like I was trying to do.  Because I was a good person and always tired to do the right thing. Don’t get me wrong I wasn’t and am not perfect. Nor a saint. 

When I found out she died. I looked into it. 

Wana take a guess how she died? Yup…. 

So apparently her affair partner wasn’t a knight in shining armor after all.

Shut  the door and left her… 

Obviously the info I info I found didn’t say that exactly. She was found near her front door the morning after allegedly suffering a serve asthma attack the evening before was what I found. She  a few days later.  

I will put money how it all really went down though…. She never had those “attacks” unless I was trying to leave her for good. Thats when she was not threatening to get me falsely arrested if I walked out the door. Which was more often than not. Same with trying to stab or shoot me. Shed immediately start hitting herself as soon as I got her disarmed and I went for the phone to call 911z she’d do the try it and let’s see who they believe. It’s your career you  loose if you get arrested she’d  say with a smirk.

I was proud of myself for always doing the right thing at that moment. Oh yeah the through crossed my mind multiple times. It would have been an escape from her and a lot less messier than a divorce. I knew she’d make any divorce hell and do her best to ruin me further (which she did). She was not a good person.  Told me she was going to have her cake and eat it too. When I confronted her about the cheating and telling her it was the final straw. We were done… All the other crap she promised to stop she was back to doing too. But she made it clear to me, this was going to be my life. Like it or not… She wasn’t stopping any of it ever. So all that played in my mind. Oh yeah, I knew it was the easy out. 

Side note. I think non stop and race through scenarios quickly. It’s natural for me  and I never learned how to shut it down until recently. Worked great for my career and the military… but it’s  also a curse at times. Lot of wasted and needless thoughts with all that what if bs…when it’s pointless..or I’d never do it anyways….’

That’s exactly how I escaped from her finally, but I put her on an ambulance and ran for my life literally (grabbed a go bag and ran)…. Let her play the victim and how dare I leave her. But damn it she was safe in medical staff hands and I was done being threatened be it my life or my career with a false arrest.  Done being with a cheater and someone who was intentionally trying to break me like a wild horse…I firmly believe she took pleasure in trying to break me. I suspect that’s what her mom did to her dad.

I look back and no regrets I did the right thing every time… I couldn’t live with having done that. 

If I had tried to tell the paramedics or hospital staff what she did. She would have found a way to blurt out the “he beats me” bullchit. Learned that lesson the hard way. And when they go into that mode not a damn one of them ever listened to what I was saying. Thankfully instead of calling 911’, I just got removed from  the hospital. One of local cops that showed up on scene for the ambulance  calls was definitely looking for a chance to jam up a man first chance she could  for a domestic battery legit or not… My ex would just smile when she showed up. Like see how close you are to losing everything.

When a doctor told me she never had  cancer (faked cancer and treatment to get me to stay at one point too) she was trying to get pain meds for her “cancer” pain.  Doc disappeared for 40 mins to an hour..  He came back pulled me aside and did the she never had cancer. He’s positive.  Then he dropped the munchowesen word. Then confronted her. She let out an evil vile screech, jumped on her phone. It wasn’t 20 minutes I swear it was so damn fast it was insane. She was being wheeled out by a private ambulance service and taken to another hospital.. I have never seen anything like that in my life!!!!!

No way that was the first time…. Why I say I’d love to talk with her ex fiancé and see all what he experienced too. She honed these skills on someone else before me. 

So I tried  to get the second hospital to call the first one and talk to the doctor. Soon as she found out, she did  “the he beats me” and I found myself being escorted out of the hospital and mother F’d.  Got a hold of the first doc and begged him to call. Yeah dude it’s safer for us to wash our hands. Can’t you put this is the notes you send over? No… Not our hot potato any more.  She’s not our problem and we are leaving this dead horse lay!!!!! Sorry you are sol….

Despite all that anger and hatred I did the right things to the best of my ability. Felt like I failed at times… That bothered me. I told her parents multiple times she needed help and that they needed  to help me get her help. They said they understood. But that help never came. But can’t risk mommies monster tells how she became the way she was. 

My conscious is clean…
I hope it haunts her affair partner at night what he did. But not my circus not my monkeys anymore either.

Bottom line you don’t want that type of bs haunting you.",0,1719819520,,,0,lb3h426,t3_1dsixzp,t1_lb3bqej,1719819534,5,False,survivinginfidelity,t5_2x8ez

DO_Kagome,,,"How do you go through life after that period of what you see as a failure? Let's just say my mom turned me against my dad, she divorced him after his accident, abandoned me and I became homeless at 16. Got into a fine mess in life and did a lot of things I wish I didn't. I am now a medical student about to be a doctor. 

How do you get through it? By holding that head high. And by high, I mean in the clouds my man. I can't tell you how proud I am of the time you've been sober. That time period in your life does not define you. Those are not failure; they are obstacles that you successfully overcame. Face what happens with your chin up and know that you are beautiful, strong, and most importantly, worth it.

Moving forward, find better cooing mechanisms. Part of what got me out of my mess was researching ""humanistic psychology"". It's about being the best YOU that you can be. It's self centered and focuses on mastering your potential. I really recommend it as it has done wonders in my life. Talk to your therapist about it and let him/her know your interest. 

To further talk, my specialty is oncology. I am going to be a cancer doctor and grief/death is quite literally my life. Watching patients slowly die while they beg you for life is not easy. So take my advice and look towards humanistic principles. Love yourself. Believe in yourself. Trust yourself.

DecompressionIllness,,Pro-choice,">That what's currently what's happening? Laws being made?  
No this is a moral positive claim not a scientific one.  
You can't prove moral claims. 

No law currently exists that says ""laws don't need to apply equally to both sexes as long as the factor is biological and not social."" therefore your original assertion is false and can be disregarded. 

>I'm stating that the inequality comes about because if outside forces we can't control (biology) 

But we CAN make things equal in regard to how those issues are dealt with. That's the point. Let's go back to your examination example. ""Women should be able to get free breast examination for breast cancer and men for testicular cancer."" Women cannot get testicular cancer and men cannot get cervical cancer (I'm using this example because men can actually get breast cancer). We can't change that. It's not anybody's fault. 

What we can do is ensure BOTH sexes have the right to access medical when they need it and ensure BOTH sexes have the right to bodily integrity. Banning one sex from having bodily integrity and access to medical care because you don't like the outcome is discrimination. 

Stripping bodily integrity and medical access from women and only women if they have sex and fall pregnant IS discrimination. Do you know how to make it equal? Either don't strip those things from women or strip them from men as well.

Responsibility is not a magic, ""get out of jail free"" care PL can use to deny someone their human rights.

You haven't proved this at all. 

>That's what's happening in this hypothetical. It seems you agree we shouldn't let the other person off the hook until such a time the other person is able to hold responsibility as well, right?

In your hypothetical BOTH are being held accountable.

Also interesting that your only way of explaining this is to use criminal activity. People who have sex and fall pregnant aren't criminals deserving of punishment. 

>And I'll say this again when it's possible for men to hold the same biological responsibility in all for putting that into law till such a time I believe child support should start at conception.

In order for this to be equal, women would also be paying CS at conception. 

The equal way to hold men accountable in the way you're doing to women is to strip their bodily rights and medical access.

I had the distinct impression that if they don't find cancer or something similar they really don't care and are resistant to investigate possibilities without being pressured. I also think they confuse probability with certainty and because maybe the majority of patients have ""functional"" problems (i.e. the doctor has no idea what's going on) they default to that as a diagnosis and will refer to a psychiatrist so they don't have to deal with it. Personally I think it would be prudent to check on the status of the erosions with another endoscopy and make sure they've not worsened.

I won't go into too much detail, but to share a little of my experience: I would teach all day with inadequate support for my students with disabilities, go to my classes in the afternoon, and then dance at a strip club at night to finance it all. I think I got 3-4 hours of sleep a night all year.

[Here's a 2 minute test](https://www.anxietycentre.com/tests/anxiety-disorder-test) you can take. It let's you know roughly where you rank in severity (if it comes back relatively low, it might be social anxiety, for example).

[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with anxiety](/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image. [More about box breathing.](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-fear-and-anxiety), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly expose yourself to situations that you know gives you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print, you can replace spider with anything, fear of driving, fear of using a phone, anything.

* [Intrusive Thoughts and Overthinking: The Skill of Cognitive Defusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3vhXQy48jo) (youtube, 1.2M views)

For the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarms, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: /r/Meditation
* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

headshot_g,,,"You screwed up, you wasted quite literally your best years to find a person doing absolutely none of that AND becoming overweight. For men who want serious relationships (meaning kids will be involved later) they are not looking to start with women already over 30. By the time you're together with them for a while, that theyre sure you're worth marrying and have enough capital in this economic clown world to make that happen... thats an extra 5? Something years added to the clock, sometimes longer. You'll be pushing 40.

If you added 5 years to a 20 year old it barely even registers. Even early 20s at 23 it puts them in a decent enough position to forge that family. Men you're after WONT be clubbing, WONT be on dating apps (which are cancer) they will either be at home doing their thing or outside doing their thing in meaningful hobbies/skill building endeavours. So you'll either meet them gaming or meet them actively engaging on sport/hiking/volunteering/at church etc. But they will be looking for women in an age bracket you arent in.

Your best bet imo, for a demographic that would still be in line with what you have and ""enough"" of what you want... would be chill whisky bars where working a conversation is key (females over 30, welcome to the male world where you have to have amazing verbal game or you get nowhere) or specific events related to something you're interested in (iunno, a space convention or woodworking convention or literally just SOMETHING) and just engage with people, be bright, be genuinely interested (dont fake this its so obvious). If you have literally nothing you're doing rn, find SOMETHING, ANYTHING, and start right freaking now, heck even collecting golf balls or some other odd hobby will still have men that will be acceptable to you. ""Being the table"" only works for 18 to 23 year olds and ONLY if they arent insufferable to be around.

And protip if nobodys ever told you this in your life, you're going to hear it right now. No man gives a flying fuck about your achievements, your degrees, your business, NONE of that. A man would be 100% more ok with dating a Hungry Jacks cashier that brightens his day and makes him feel amazing than a Masters degree, boss babe tech startup tycoon or anything like that. DO NOT project what women want in men to what men want in women, Im astounded by what so many women zive talked to think men are interested in and how is literally just what they look for in guys... truly it is not, we dont care if you're penniles from a 3rd world country, we only care if you improve our quality of life with your existence because we are PLENTY capable of functioning solo as thats a male default setting. Men have an extra probably 20 years on their timeline women dont have, thats just a biological fact we're born with, so us settling for a woman means she has to tick the boxes a family requires the woman to be. Does including you in that mans life improve it in any way? Is the mental cost-benefit of adding a gf to his life being outweighed by the bright energy, fun, thoughtfulness, skills, feminine energy etc. that girl can bring and is suited to? If you dont have an answer to this, this is why you cant keep a man around, work on being this and you will see results (or dont, its your life your choices, but dont blame me when guys ignore you).

Also ffs stop sleeping with your tinder dates, you're literally part of the problem. Why would men anywhere actually invest in women if women on tinder keep giving what they want from them with minimal short term effort? If every single woman on the planet KEPT THEIR LEGS SHUT until a certain standard is met, that standard would be met overnight. Ai can already hear the armies of fembots and redditards going ""but it shouldnt be on women to repress their sexuality"" or whatever else they come up with.... but it is. We dont have billions of *grapes every year from men just taking what they want when they want it from any woman in eyeshot. Women hold total control over access to p*ssy and thats just reality, so USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE as a filter.

So in short, GET SKILLS MEN CARE ABOUT which are not skills women care about in men (if you can homecook a fantastic meal from scratch you're 70% of the way there), up your verbal game because men at this stage of life will do literally anything else than have drole conversation, dont be insufferable to be around (or a feminist) and dont still be overweight as thats just a public advertisement that you lack the self-control, discipline and respect for yourself... let alone what it might mean for other people. 

All of these things are something you can achieve with purely effort and minimal to no money.

PunisherX20,,,"I would like to address those who believe that individuals should suffer consequences for smoking pot. While I understand that our current laws—shaped by democratic processes, political agendas, and historical influences from organizations like the FDA—classify marijuana as illegal, it's important to critically examine these perspectives.

Many opinions are formed without substantial research into the effects of marijuana. I urge everyone, including critics (like Zen-whatever), to think independently instead of blindly following outdated beliefs, misinformation from WhatsApp forwards, or political party lines. Independent thinking can significantly benefit society as a whole.

Despite marijuana's few negative aspects, substantial evidence supports its medical benefits for certain ailments and psychological disorders. For instance: - Chronic Pain, PTSD, anxiety, stress, Multiple Sclerosis.

If society genuinely cared about addressing substances that cause harm, we would prioritize banning alcohol, which has a far more detrimental impact. alcohol is responsible for about 3 million deaths globally each year and is linked to over 200 diseases and injury conditions, including liver cirrhosis and various cancers.

As a fellow Indian, I implore you to avoid being a follower without question. Think critically, research thoroughly, and make informed decisions. This approach will lead to a more enlightened and healthier society.

We are currently seeing other countries like Brazil, Thailand, USA etc currently overthrow the old Authoritarianism rule by legalizing but I guess we are still far away in India because of people not thinking for themselves, corrupt police and politicians who keep benefiting due to the illegality of the same.

These are so much easier said than done, but my best two pieces of advice --

1. Realize this stress will get you nowhere. If worrying could cure cancer, it'd be cured l. If you spend all this energy stressing out and it's a good outcome, what was the stress for? Nothing. I'd you spend all this energy stressing out and it's the (very unlikely) bad outcome, why did you waste your time with stress? Realize it's pointless.

2. Worry about what you can control, focus on what you can control. This is going to all appointments, being an informed patient, taking your medication, and taking good gentle care of yourself. 

Luckily, the vast majority (>95%) of thyroid cancer is curable. Life will very likely return to a new thyroid less normal and you can live a great long life with your love!

Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.

You can manage things with therapy, but I would be lying if I said it ever got better. It doesn't. It's just there, like a cancer, contributing nothing and making your life worse, slowly killing you over time. And yeah, as much as I hate Autism \[Talks\] as an organization, I hope that someone can find a cure, or at least a way to prevent your children from developing it. 

In the meantime, I've kinda managed to assimilate. Emphasis on kinda. The freakouts and meltdowns still happen at home, but I manage to hold them off until nobody else can see them. I can make eye contact like normal people do by following the 8-10 second rule for eye contact, then look 4 seconds away at something random. Does it cause me to scream inside for no fucking reason other than autism? Absolutely. The biggest thing that does me in isn't necessarily the autism though. It's the anxiety that you go through knowing that everybody can see you're different, and even with all the resources and information out there, the majority of the population lives in ignorance. 

The first thing I would do is try to find a therapist that specializes in dealing with autistic patients. I'm not sure which country you're in, but if you're in one with universal healthcare, this will likely be easier. The second, and this is often the tough part, but force yourself to reach out to people. It's uncomfortable, but you find that most people you might not have spoken to in a while will actually be glad to speak to you, or at least will be kind enough to tell you a simple no. 

As for meltdowns, seriously, please find a therapist. Cognitive behavioral therapy and other treatments will help.

My best friend was my cousin. He died of cancer a few years ago (which was what pushed me to get to retirement as early as possible). My best teaching friend was a female who was also my age…she died last year, also of cancer. She’d gone through 30+ rounds of chemo, and always helped me keep things in perspective.

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically.

[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with anxiety](/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image. [More about box breathing.](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-overcome-fear-and-anxiety), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly expose yourself to situations that you know gives you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print, you can replace spider with anything, fear of driving, fear of using a phone, anything.

Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it.

It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work.

If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

CaligoAccedito,,Partassipant [2],"Rats really do make great pets. They're very social, can learn their names, do lots of tricks, and they like being tickled! They're smart enough that learning tricks is good for them, as it helps prevent boredom and depression. They *usually* do well in pairs, because they can get lonely when you're not around.

However, I'll probably never have another pet rat unless I take on someone else's, despite loving the little critters with my whole heart. 

While some can live as long as 5 years, they more commonly only live about 3. It's very common for pet store rats to develop cancer, as they're not usually bred with care but just for volume as feeder animals; you can seek out a pet or training breeder, but they're more rare. You'll need to look for a vet that has a strong focus on ""exotic"" animals to get comprehensive care for them, and surgery on them is very expensive and I've always been told it was high risk.

All that said, I would 100% recommend a rat to anyone who was considering a hamster for their kid. They're sweeter, smarter, and more naturally social (hamsters are mostly solitary), while still taking up a similar amount of space (most people keep even their hamsters in too-small enclosures) and resources.",0,1719848446,,,0,lb5340j,t3_1dsojqu,t1_lb4vogc,1719848462,1,False,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq

3.6 million contraception related services
935,573 cancer screenings including breast exams and Pap tests
1.1 million pregnancy tests and prenatal services

ArrowheadDZ,,,"The thing we’ve lost sight of is this:  the Federalist Society is profoundly well funded, highly organized, and has infiltrated every law school in the country.  It is virtually impossible for a law student to hold any leadership position or have a prestigious role like being the school’s law review editor without having the connections that accompany Society membership.

And in fact, people forget that in March and again in June, 2016, candidate Trump was trailing in the polls, and then made a public campaign promise to only appoint judges and justices recommended to him by the Federalist Society.  He literally promised to outsource the nominating process to the society, and nominate   whoever they told him to nominate.  His polling jump 3% when he first published his list of 21 possible SCOTUS candidates, and jumped again in June when he promised that he would always nominate whoever he was told and wouldn’t go “rogue” as other presidents had done.

Why do I recount all this here?  Because what we fail to realize is that the Federalist Society, despite its name and its elite, influential standing, is profoundly and deeply anti-democracy.  Their central tenet, their litmus test for judgeship, for campus leadership, for scholarships, is adherence to their president-as-serial-monarch philosophy.  They give it glossy names like unitary executive, but if you read the writings of proponents like Bill Barr or Alberto Gonzales, it becomes very clear that the President is the leader of the people, and not simply the head of the executive branch.

The Federalist Society was part of a well-funded long term war plan to wrest control of the government by going after the courts, rather than through electoral means, and they have succeeded.  They placed adherents in the vice presidency, two attorneys general, hundreds of state and federal judgeships, and what appears to be at least 5 but possibly 6 Justices.

We are completely distracted.  We worry about MAGA, we worry about the likes of Desantis and Abbott, we worry about the theocracy now in place in Louisiana and Oklahoma, and coming soon elsewhere.  But those battles are just that, planned distractions that take our eye of the serial monarchy, the “dictator lite” model that the Federalist Society promotes.  They have no transparency, no accountability, are unelected,and yet they represent the single most powerful voice in American governance, bar none.

Between the Federalist Society and Project 2025, we are facing a complete dismantling of the democracy experiment.  We’re just two years shy of the 250 year anniversary, and by all accounts it appears we couldn’t make it.

I won’t candy coat any of this.  If we don’t find a way to stop the Federalist Society and rid ourselves of the lethal cancer they represent, there’s no way out of this.  This is a stage 4 malignancy, it’s spread everywhere, and that was always the plan.  Their plan was always for the chains of authoritarianism to be too light to be felt, until they were too strong to be broken.

I don’t care who you are, or what story you’ve told yourself… if you are a member of, a supporter of, or sympathetic to the Federalist Society, no matter the reason, you are the single existential threat to democracy in America.  You either know it, or are deliberately turning a blind eye to it, but don’t lie and say you weren’t aware.

I don’t know what the right answer is.  We’re America, so rounding you up and putting you in indoctrination camps is pretty antithetical to our principles.  But I don’t see anyway that a liberal democracy has ever been able to break the authoritarian groundswells that have devours so many educated, industrialized, free nations.  The Democratic Party lacks the backbone to use the powers the courts are granting the executive, and so our government is a ratchet that can only move on one direction.  Nationalist authoritarian movements tighten the bolt when they have the wrench, and liberals just hold steady on the status quo, with no will to losses the bolt, undoing the damage of the previous tightening.  And so the bolt only turns one way, and the only thing we’re left to decide is whether it tightens faster or slower.",0,1719848779,,,0,lb5447q,t3_1dsupsh,t3_1dsupsh,1719848793,52,False,politics,t5_2cneq

AngeredReclusivity,,Nursing Student 🍕,"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but: It's not just America. Most people just don't research other countries' health problems to know otherwise. 

For example, the media continuously will swear the US has the highest obesity and cancer rates when that's not true. We're top 5 for both, but not number one, with many countries in the Western world's obesity rates skyrocketing (and even outside the western world). American food can't be blamed for that, especially since other countries swear their food is healthier. 

Microplastics is a global problem, with many countries in the East suffering worse because they're the countries that ""recycle"" most of our plastic. I truly don't think we'll ever fix that issue (at least in my lifetime). 

Diseases evolve and change. Of course we'll have diseases that didn't exist hundreds of years ago. Part of that is due to how we live now and others because humans weren't living nearly as long as we do now. That's not an accurate indicator of general issues. We no longer have the Bubonic plague pandemic because of advances in medicine.

People are blaming healthcare alone, but for prevention to actually be viable, you have to fix the financial disparities in the US/elsewhere. Telling someone to eat fruits and veggies when they live in an area with corner stores/liquor stores/no grocery stores is like talking to the wall. Or telling someone to shop whole food items on a minimum wage salary while having 2 kids is like falling on deaf ears.

Finally, some people don't listen/care. We know cigarettes cause cancer at this point, yet people still smoke and will smoke until they die. This is actually a postulation as to the prevalence of certain cancers in Europe (high tobacco use).",0,1719849279,,,0,lb55mxo,t3_1dspznz,t3_1dspznz,1719849296,8,False,nursing,t5_2ra72

So the neurosurgeon that did the back surgery shows up and discussed what she saw, follow up care, and that she found a mass in my lower abdomen.  It ended up being cancer.  About 3 hours later, I was told I had covid as well. 10 months later, 9 rounds of kemo, a very long surgery at mayo clinic 13 lymphnodes removed, a tumor remove, and one mega dose of kemo for a week and Im cancer free.

TXRedheadOverlord,,,"Rodney Smith Jr., founder of Raising Men & Women Lawn Care. 

It all started when Rodney noticed an elderly man struggling to mow his lawn, so he mowed it for free. After that, he started seeking out elderly people to see if he could help them with their lawns at no charge.

Then he got the idea to encourage kids across the US to find people \[elderly, veterans, disabled, single parents\] who need help with their lawns and mow for free. Kids get a different-colored t-shirt as they knock out yards up until they get to 50. Once they reach 50 lawns, they get a free mower, t-shirt, and other lawn supplies. 

He regularly travels the country to deliver the mowers and supplies to the kids who make it to their 50th yard. He sometimes has a custom pushmower made to raise money/awareness for charities \[eg breast cancer\]. He also travels to each state around Christmas with another do-gooder friend of his, dressing up in costumes to deliver gifts to disabled children and their families.

And because he's just cool like that, he also takes little bubble mowers to preschools/day cares and has bubble mowing races with the kids. He also gives them to the young ones so they can bubble their elderly neighbors' yards alongside their siblings.

He's as apolitical a person you will find. He's simply a regular guy who saw a need, figured he could fill that need, and did so. He never promotes himself; it's always promoting the kids and the value of service to others. He's awesome.

SlowSwanSong,,Partner of NDX,"I'm going to be honest and say I think it may be time to look at your codependency. 

A lot of codependents of alcoholics continue enabling their loved-one's addiction with claims that they ""can't"" just let them take care of things themselves, because they'll be lose their job or become homeless or die. But often these things happen anyway, it's just delayed with a lot more suffering in the meantime. Additionally, it's usually only when the codependent lets go that the person is allowed to hit the rock-bottom they need to hit to get help, or they don't, but at least one of the two people is free of the pain of the addiction, rather than both of them drowning.

Your partner truly has to start dealing with the consequences of their own behavior, their own problems, their own illness. You cannot continue to attempt to rescue them from those consequences. I understand that in this scenario, unfortunately, you also have to deal with those consequences, because if they don't take meds or go to appointments you probably end up suffering more than they do. If they don't have a meal planned when you're out for the evening, they have to figure it out or go hungry. Maybe this even has to happen when you're around too, simply because you're busy or need to relax one night instead of making dinner.

They're not a cancer patient in your care, they're an adult with an issue that *can* be manageable. If they truly need this much outside help to function, they can pay to hire a caretaker to wake them up, book their appointments, take them to them, etc. All the work you're doing. You are not their caretaker, you're their wife.

If it's their reactions you're afraid of, they're blaming of you and accusations, this is something you have to develop immunity to. Once you work on the only problem you really have, which is lack assertiveness, self-esteem, self-compassion, boundaries—your codependency—you'll be so confident that what they're railing at you about isn't fair or yours or valid that it can't touch you.

And yeah, you’re right, a lot of degrees are going to be able to be replaced with AI. Kinda proves the fact that productivity going up, wages being stagnant, and job availability is going down. Probably why the concept of a UBI has become more seriously considered in the past few years. 

As I responded to the other comment with too, tradespeople put their bodies through incredible stress too. For example, I worked with my father in Florida after Hurricane Ian. I can prove two of my points right now. 1st, after the hurricane, do you know how many people started working as wet drywall removers and demolition contractors? Take a wild guess as to how good the money was after the market was saturated. It was barely worth it to offer it as a service from our company, but we had to because it kept the company doing business, even if it was for low value. Same thing would happen if every college grad decided out of high school that welding is neat. All of a sudden, welders would make a lot less money if everyone knew how to weld. 2nd, do you think all of the self employed contractors in Florida were following OSHA guidelines during those removals and demo jobs? Do you think they were all wearing respirators when removing enough black mold to make even the french upset? No, they weren’t. They’re making good money today as contractors, but when they get a severe fungal respiratory infection tomorrow or develop cancers from exposure to the shit in construction materials and whatever grows on them after being flooded, that treatment is expensive and their quality of life suffers.

AMCreative,,SAG-AFTRA | TV/Film,"Couldn’t disagree harder. Let’s dissect.

“Look at all of these people who never took a class”

This is a logical fallacy called “Survivor Bias”. Other examples are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never having gone to college.

“I have taken 5 classes and only 1 was decent”

This is a statistical error centered around sample size.

If I told you I had a medication that cured cancer because 5 people took it and 1 went into remission would you trust that pill?

“I could have learned all of these things on my own”

And you should. IMO classes and self-motivated learning are independent tracks. One augments the fruits of the other.

“Long time students with the teacher have no credits”

And? 95% of actors don’t make a living acting. That’s the likelihood of you pulling any actor out of the wind and checking their credits, not just long term actors with a coach.

Further, and you should know this as a business major, acting classes rarely teach explicitly acting business strategy and entrepreneurship. So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren’t regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students… don’t do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher’s fault?

“I’ve had acting coaches tell me I’d never book a co Star then I did”

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

“Coaches don’t want people to be successful because they won’t study anymore”

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You’re not even thinking your arguments through now.

“I’ve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique”

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it’s something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it’s on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

—-

It feels like you’re treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don’t see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it’s always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I’m at the point where, generally, I don’t learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

I once found a squirrel partially run over, surrounded by traffic. Obviously, it was badly injured.  Couldn't move although its front legs were scrambling. Horrible. I pulled over, scooped it up in a sweater, and rushed out over to a vet who euthanized the squirrel.

I mentioned this in another comment but we love rules, and know the rules we made a decision to let him run the game and to let the game happen because playing was more important and our availability is limited.

It's important because what little time we have we chose to spend with them playing DND, our family decided to treat us like shit for reasons we don't know.

SpiderCop_NYPD_ARKND,,,"Keyword ""perceived"", as it does none of the above as a part of its modern fiction or intention.

I work in Health Insurance with the ACA, so I'll go over all 3 of those: 

(1) The current ACA doesn't overreach government authority at all. Everything the current ACA does,  it does with existing Government Authority, the two exceptions,  the initial requirement that States expand their Medicaid programs to cover anyone with income at or below the Federal Poverty Level,  was struck down before the law ever took effect in 2014, and the requirement for individuals to have Health Insurance coverage or face a fee on their taxes was reduced to zero in 2018 (though this actually did more harm than good,  see 1A).

(1A) The requirement for private individuals to have coverage or face a fine was actually a cost saving measure. By having a many people covered as possible, they increased the pool of premiums paid in, which is the pool used to pay out claims. By removing that requirement and shrinking that pool, Insurance providers (companies) have had to raise premiums to keep up with the increased numbers and costs of claims from expanded access. All insurance uses this pool & pay system, good drivers car insurance is used to pay the claims of accident prone drivers. People who live in places with good weathers home insurance premiums are used to pay claims of people who live in tornado alley or in coastal areas with hurricanes. Healthy peoples health insurance premiums were already used to pay for sick people's claims. All removing the requirement for was shrink the pool and make it more expensive for everyone. Which has just exacerbated the cost increases to be addressed in point 2.

(2) Cost is something difficult to understand,  so I'm going to get into how costs have increased as a result of the ACA to help people understand that it really isn't the ACAs fault. To start,  it must be understood that *access* to Healthcare is different than *having* Healthcare. Access to Healthcare is having insurance and doctors/hospitals/pharmacy services (providers) that take that insurance that you could choose to use. Healthcare is the services those providers, well, provide. The ACA is there to provide access,  not Healthcare.  It helps people get and afford insurance. It does not,  however, educate or hire new doctors, specialists or, pharmacists, build new hospitals or doctors offices,  or otherwise increase the number of providers available. So, basic supply and demand applies,  if you increase the number of people with access (demand) but don't increase the number of providers (supply), what happens is basic economics,  the suppliers raise prices. These people are in are also more expensive to treat,  which I'll cover in 2A. *However*, things don't stop there.  With increased demand,  supply always tries to expand to meet it. But with specialized services like Healthcare,  that takes time.  If fast food demand goes up,  you can train a thousand new fry cooks in a week if the labor pool is there, but it takes upwards of a decade to become a general practice doctor, longer to become a specialist. Supply hasn't had enough time to answer the increase in demand yet. Further, people having access to and using Healthcare will in the long run reduce costs,  because someone who can go get that funny feeling checked out and catches their cancer at stage 1 is cheaper and easier to treat than that same person without access who let's it faster into they end up in the ER and discover it at stage 4, but that also takes decades to happen. How do we know all this? Because we've seen it happen in dozens of nations that instituted single payer systems in the latter half of the 20th century.  The same patterns played out every time,  an initial huge spike in costs, followed by a gradual decline as demand expanded and general public beauty improved. We're just happen to still be in the spike.

(2A) There's also the fact that the ACA eliminated the ability of Insurance Companies to discriminate against the people most in need of coverage,  people with preexisting conditions. If you had something like arthritis,  and you had a gap in coverage (for whatever reason) longer than a certain period,  *if* you got renewed coverage (they could also simply refuse your business entirely) insurance used to be able to just tell you you were out of luck regarding coverage of your arthritis because it was preexisting with a period where it was unmanaged. Sucked for you,  but it saved the insatiable company money (and thus,  saved those they would cover money since they weren't paying premiums to cover those claims). The ACA made it so that they have to cover you and can't charge you more for having preexisting conditions.

(3) I've actually already covered the effect on private insurance really, those who previously already had coverage are now competing with ACA coverage recipients for a limited supply of provider services, so they're seeking the price increases as well as having harder times getting appointments.

But all of it,  all of this,  is secondary effects and side effects of *trying to fix what was fundamentally a broken system*, a system designed to  cover healthy people and fuck over everyone who actually needed Healthcare. Working in this field, the people who I hear complain about it,  are the ones who were benefiting from that system as it was before,  healthy or well off people who had insurance before the changes and didn't get shafted by it at the time who are bitching about the fact that the system is working to cover people it wouldn't before and that's making things (momentarily, as I've explained above) more expensive.",0,1719853101,,,0,lb5hc8p,t3_1dswbj3,t1_lb54utl,1719853119,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i

I’m going to paste a response I made to someone else because I think it would apply to you, and I’ll also add that nipples can shrivel up at even very slight stimulation so unless it looked so weird to the point where your breast looks dented or something I wouldn’t worry much about the shriveling. Here’s what I had said previously to someone:

I’m so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I’ve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery— they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn’t see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She’s not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it’s something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it’s really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day. You don’t mess around with this shit, and if your doctor seems to not be taking you seriously, find a new one.

My mom's (62yo) breast cancer is back. I'm an only child (34F) and live in a big city with my husband and 8yo daughter. My mom's been married 6 different times, and the last time she had cancer she was married in a different state and her then husband cared for her. I did also go there to visit and help, even though I had a baby.

Last year, she left the city where I live, sold her apt and moved to a small town 3h away, where her best friend lives. She bought a great house with a yard and four dogs, it's her dream life and I'm happy for her. However, she is an older woman with a chronic illness, and decided to live alone in a random town. She says she can't stand living in a big city anymore and I understand. However, I think she did not think this through.

Since we found out the cancer was back, me and my husband decided I had to go there for her surgery and all. This is really disruptive for us, cause we don't have a lotof help. It's just us and our close friends looking out for eachother and the kids. I WFH, so it's simple enough to work from my mom's place.

I was there for five days and the surgery had gone really well, we were back to her house, I was cooking and cleaning and taking care of the dogs. However, it's difficult because I don't get along with my mom, she left to France when I was 16 to marry a French man, and left me with my abusive father. She eventually came back, but I moved away, and we haven't lived together for almost 20 years. She doesn't say things clearly and criticizes me constantly, even though she won't admit she does this. Also, she considers our relationship to be close and good, and in her opinion she never ""left"" me.

So, I sat her down to ask her what the plan was. Since she had chosen to move away by herself, what was she thinking in terms of healthcare, how could we help support her, anyway, it's her life and she's a grown woman and I cant choose for her. This really upset her. She said I was ""demanding"" things she couldn´t possibly know, and that she doesn't ""think about being sick"", it's touch and go. I told her that if she doesn't plan for times like these, we have to, and that's not fair. So, she was very offended and said she thinks it's ""natural"" for someone with ""empathy"" to be there for loved ones. She refused to make plans or think things through, and finally said I don't have to be there if it's such an effort.

So, I left. I cried a lot, I said I wish her the best. But I can't stay there indeffinitely, and especially not like this. I need to be able to talk, and I need to be treated like her daughter, and not her tutor. I came home to care for my daughter who was really upset I wasn't here.

I'm heartbroken and this is difficult for me, but I think finally ""divorcing"" my mom will be a great thing, actually. She may see me as a selfish person, but that's ok. I can't be a good daughter to her, and she's not really a good mom to me either. AITA?

Additionally even with your higher net worth you are one **very serious** medical emergency away from being financially destitute.

Now this is obviously an anecdote so take it as you will but growing up I knew someone whose husband killed themselves because they had a cancer diagnosis. They didn't end their own life because they couldn't deal with the pain/stress of the cancer itself, it was quite literally the fact that they had a family that they didn't want to see go into massive amounts of debt to keep him alive when he would probably die anyway.

It was made brilliant by the glimpses of how dier it was underneath the staffs attempt to keep my stay calm. 

I was in isolation but thankfully had energy to take some jobs off the staff (monitoring my fluid intake/output). And any new nurses would see my list of things and go ""oh my god this is brilliant!"". They'd love to sit and chat with me because I wasn't causing too much trouble and would talk about everything and anything but the hospital.

I saw it when my care would stall too. My gallbladder decided to try and kill me and I was septic. The haematology doctor had to chase the surgeon down in the hallways to get him to slot me in and get my treasonous gallbladder out and not wait the six weeks they make you chill out so your gallbladder is easier to extract. The surgeon checked on me three times the day after the surgery and apologised like mad to me because my scars were larger than promised. You could feel his stress fizzle out when I made jokes to say I didn't care at all.

youaremagic,,,"Maybe a preventative vaccine, much like Gardasil for HPV, I can see happening in my life time. Better meds/treatments, too. I don’t think a cure is on the horizon personally. The reason has many layers. 1 - I don’t dismiss the toll this takes on anyone but without any long term health implications, HSV doesn’t have any urgency attached. If HSV caused adverse effects, thank God it doesn’t, then a movement to improve testing/treatment would have some traction. 2 - People suffer/deal with it silently. The shame attached, which a lot of health care professionals perpetuate by their lack of knowledge, means people aren’t beating down doors and running to their congressman. Some also wave a hand at it. “No big deal”; complacency cancels out urgency. I’m not saying that those with HSV be defined by it or stop their lives, acceptance is so healthy, but if a majority don’t care, so to speak, nobody will care. 
3- Research Scientists go where the funding is plentiful and the greatest impact is to be had, not to mention maybe a bit of prestige. HIV, childhood cancers, COVID. These all scream urgency because they are urgent.

So those are a few of the reasons why I am not holding my breath. What we should he hopeful for is testing that is worth a damn and new medications that help keep the virus at bay. ",0,1719839556,,,0,lb4eigl,t3_1dsn0lf,t3_1dsn0lf,1719839571,17,False,HSVpositive,t5_3ieox

My dad's aunt was really sick and slowly dying of cancer. My dad was the only one who cared for her. He went by there multiple times a week to check on her and help her, take her to her appointments, make sure she took her medicine, etc.

Meanwhile, his brother was constantly getting into trouble that my father had to bail him out of, his sister was in an abusive marriage that she refused to recognize as such, the entire family was a mess.

And all of this while my dad was working like 3 jobs too.

So finally my great aunt dies and she leaves everything to my dad.

His brother and sister are furious, even though he gives them both a share of the inheritance anyway. They accuse him of brainwashing her against them and doctoring the will.

They barely speak for the next 5 years.

His brother eventually pops up out of the woodwork, says he's gotten clean and gotten his life together, invites us all to his wedding. So we go and have a great time. My dad thinks at least that part of the rift has been healed.

A year or two later, he gets this horrible poison-pen letter from his brother, blaming my dad for every misstep and detail of his screwed up life.

And then he continues to get one just about every year for the next decade or so.

Eventually his brother dies and he's inconsolable at the fact that he was never able to fix their relationship.

Then in 2019 my dad died and for the final insult, when we called his sister to tell her, she said, ""Oh. Alright, well thanks for letting me know."" and she hung up on us.

DueCalendar5022,,,"I have gone through lots of stages dealing with my issues.  There was a time I felt really tired and slept a lot.  I was really stressed, alone, and scared of dying. I had to get up and go to work.  That helped.  It was a time I needed to be hypervigilant and focus on caring for myself emotionally and physically. I didn't have a TV or radio and internet didn't exist.  It was my first stage.  Healing happens gradually.  How do you heal cancer? Listen to your body.

I started managing my time as a teenage because I believe that what you do everyday will have a bigger impact on your life than self-evaluation, worry, or a lifetime goal.  I was a high school dropout, single mother, who  went to the library and wanted to become a systems engineer.  I didn't try to do that but it is eventually what I became.  I needed to heal.  Your body knows how to do that if you treat it right. 

I didn't know a soul.  I took an art class.  I talked to woman who told me to put my child in foster care and go to school (I didn't do that).  Instead I went down to the unemployment agency with my baby and cried every single time the mill laid me off.  They put me in a program that allowed me to go to school and paid minimum wage for the hours I attended.  

I read Helter Skelter and nailed the windows shut in the house I was living in.  After that I was very careful about the mental environment I was creating for myself and my child.  Healthy, healthy, healthy!  I had a go to routine for the days I felt sick and a plan for days I felt better.  I saw a woman walking one early morning.  She had obviously been beaten but she was still getting up and getting out.  I knew that path is easy to go down if you rely on others. 

 I hope you don't have anything like these issues to deal with.  Life can be very hard.  There isn't a plan, but there is lots of room for healing if you allow it to happen.

We did treatment (radiation) and she was in remission for almost 3 years before it returned and we opted for palliative care.

I will say, prednisone is an excellent drug for nasal cancer in that it reduces the symptoms, so I would be very cautious. She may very well have nasal cancer and seems like she’s improving because the steroid is reducing inflammation. Definitely schedule a scope and CT. And do it with a facility that has a radiation oncology dept. When you schedule there will likely be a 1+ month wait. Ask to be put on the cancellation list and ask scheduling to let oncology know that it’s for a suspected nasal tumor. They will get you in sooner if they can.

I never had any health-related issues that I knew of and my last dr visit was in 2015 where my labs were good but my weight was 275. I believe my weight was 250-275 most of my adult life until a few years prior to covid where I started creeping up and in 2022 I randomly logged my weight at 345 and then 3 months ago when said ""health scare"" happened (chest pain/pressure and other related issues that seemed like heart issues - especially considering my friend who had a widowmaker blockage was all basically identical in symptoms to his) I topped out at 401lbs.

Either way, went to dr, elevated enzymes, got US liver enlarged at 22cm, get asked about weight loss surgery (hard no to me), get told I wouldn't qualify for transplant if I needed it, yaddy yadda.

Instantly quit smoking (since 16), cutting all liquid sugar/HFCS and started researching FLD, Cirrhosis, etc  and while I would recommend against Dr. Google (everything will be cancer) I started buying tons of supplements that are supposed to be good for the heart, liver, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidants. Things like TUDCA, Milk Thistle, Omega-3s (I never ever eat things from the water), NAC, and a host of other's. I do personally believe they are all placebos for the most part but whatever.

Anyway, also started walking 40 minutes every day, Saturday/Sunday we usually do 60 minutes (20 minutes after dinner). Down 65 lbs in 3 months. Labs have all been trending down each month since, and next week I'll get another set which will be 2 months since my last and I'm basically expecting nothing to be abnormal or at least extremely close to normal ranges.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.

moonmanmonkeymonk,,,"I’m a fairly recent convert — grew up in a “meat and potatoes” family. Occasionally my mom would put down a salad or boil some brussels sprouts. We mostly ignored it.  

Two years ago I discovered that the meat I was eating was the primary cause of my kidney disease — the disease that killed my mother. I switched to being vegan overnight. In the past two years I’ve only eaten one hamburger, one piece of fish, and one order of chicken strips (Complicated reasons. I regretted every time. It won’t happen again.) No eggs, no dairy, etc. 

The hardest part was cooking food for my kids, knowing I was feeding them the same poisons that caused all my health problem and killed their grandparents. But they’re young. They have time… 

Here’s the thing — Foods can be just as addicting as drugs. In fact, it’s a somewhat blurry line between food and drugs. Grapefruit is known to have dangerous interactions with a lot of drugs. Interactions between aflatoxin (from moldy peanuts, in amounts smaller than anyone can taste) and casein (the protein in dairy) is known to cause liver cancer — 100% of the time in high enough doses (still lower than you can taste. ref: *The China Study*, T. Colin Campbell). 

This is controversial, but I believe it will be proven eventually. Meat is addicting, just like alcohol and other drugs. Meat is more than just protein. It is saturated with hormones and fatty acids that affect the gut microbiome and allow those hormones to pass through the gut, directly into your blood stream, where they do what hormones do in your body. Other mammal's hormones are all similar enough to human hormones that your body is somewhat confused about how to react to them, causing problems. This study needs to be done! 

If you listen carefully to meat eaters make their excuses, they’ll sound familiar to anyone who’s had experience with any other kind of addict. I think we’d make better progress if we start treating the overconsumption or meat like an addiction. 

While I’m 100% whole-food vegan myself, the evidence is clear that consuming 5% to 8% of your total calories from meat (preferably fish) is not necessarily bad for most people. Meanwhile, our meat and dairy production is still devastating for the biodiversity of the planet, for the climate, and is morally *evil* (I was going to say reprehensible, but the more you know….) 

We need to treat meat like an addiction — if you ate chocolate cake, cherry pie, and tiramisu at every meal, no one would dispute that’s too much. Those are treats, not staples. If you drank beer and wine and whiskey at every meal no one would dispute that you have a problem. Meat is the same. We’ve been oversold on the importance of protein. Meat protein is no better for you than plant protein, and if you’re getting enough calories, you’re getting enough protein, no matter what its source. Meanwhile, the importance of fiber is tremendously under-acknowledged, and animal products have *zero* fiber.)  

Meat is a treat. It is a supplement to an otherwise perfectly adequate diet, and like sweets and alcohol and salty processed foods, it is addicting.  In the history of human evolution, it has always been that way. It needs to be that way again.

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I’m making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I’ve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I’m in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60’s. I’d like to think that I’ve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo’s, one 14yo). It’s all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it’s a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won’t really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we’d have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we’ve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I’m very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don’t particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I’ve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I’ve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life…I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what’s the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They’ll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they’d have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

A global pandemic that was seriously mishandled by trump who completely disregarded the play book to handle such a situation because it was created by his predecessor. Because of his incompetence many people lost their jobs, and many others lost their lives. 

>Inflation through the roof

Inflation has been happening all over the world, not just the US. 

>Prices of everything are sky high while income isn’t up 

Why are you blaming the president instead of the corporations that are raising the prices of everything despite showing record profits? Speaking of income, which party keeps fighting against raising the minimum wage? It isn't the democrats.

>Medical supplies are at an all time high. Healthcare at all time high. 

And which party wants to tank the ACA and refuses to allow price negotiations on those supplies? Again - not the democrats. 

>Wants to get rid of tax cuts? What president says that lol? 

You mean the tax cuts that grossly inflated our deficit? 

>Embarrassment throughout the world. 

That was the other guy. 

>The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a national embarrassment and a shame on his part. 

That was negotiated by trump and scheduled to happen after he left office. 

>The mass funding of people’s wars is an embarrassment. 

Even more embarrassing is that trump knew putin was planning to invade a neighboring country and didn't say or do anything to discourage it because they're besties.

>Immigration worse than ever resulting in people being killed by immigrants on a DAILY basis. 

Illegal immigration is down. People are killed by other fully American citizens on the daily as well.

ZebraZealousideal558,,,"I did look into abnormal paps after I had my first but that was in 2009 but don’t recall much education about HPV until the vaccine became a big deal. When I got the vaccine it was only for women and my memory is that at that time HPV was only harmful to women. Or at least that was my 19 year old self interpretation of it. 

I did do research again in 2019, again I don’t recall there being much of an emphasis of the impact on men and if 8 remember correctly the idea that men are mostly carriers was prominent. My boyfriend at the time was aware of my diagnosis, but again there was never the thought it put him at risk of anything. I thought I was going to be with him forever so never really considered additional transmission. 

I didn’t start dating again until late 2020, after my negative HPV results in 2020. I had two partners before my next positive HPV result in 2022. Honestly I didn’t start seeing information about informing partners until I started doing extensive research when I had pre-cancer cells. I’ve really only seen info about informing partners since looking at Reddit threads about CIN and experiences with that. I recall even being told by my doctor at one point that informing people wasn’t necessary since it was “so common.”

In hindsight, I’m Trying to take some responsibility for this. I’m generally a pretty knowledgeable person about healthcare and thought I was a considerate person.

They’ve been raised to believe that if they do everything they’re told: get married young, start popping out kids, etc. then they will be highly valued and therefore safe. 

They think that abortion and birth control laws are for promiscuous women; but as soon as the fetal test comes back with a fatal abnormality, they want that abortion and are shocked that it isn’t an option. They think women are more valuable & fulfilled as stay at home moms & tradwives; which is why they never see it coming when their husbands leave them at 40 for a woman 20 years younger. They think their husbands care for and value and love them; until they get breast cancer and find out their husbands would rather divorce them than give even an ounce of that caring back.

Are you taking Electrolytes? It takes a while for you body to adjust to the diet as it's been fueled on Sugar/ carbs. There's many people out there that give great advice. We as a species weren't designed to be powered by Sugar, the most addictive substance in the world. Sure it will sustain you just as my ancestors lived/ survived on Potatoes. Extra Sugar turns straight to fat, but they were active and didn't have the calories available to get fat. 
Big Food is the biggest pusher of sugar, why do you think they put it in EVERYTHING? That's what dealers do, get people addicted to their products for Profit and silence the competition. 
Big food and pharma own the politicians and they will not tolerate anyone that challenges that monopoly. That's the reason they are going after the""Quacks"" that promote keto and carnivore diets, natural medicines and taking a holistic approach. They actively shadow ban anyone that won't comply as they are all in it together. 

Rockefeller started the American cancer society to do just that after his oil based ' medicine "" started giving people, you guessed it, CANCER. HE sponsored the medical community and flooded it with his henchmen to keep his profits flowing. Anyone that bucked the system was immediately labeled a quack and ostracized so voices were silenced. 


We are being played by the system, a system that pushes pills that treats but doesn't cure. They spend billions on advertising money that will be better spent on research. 

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

Mine was under the impression that it was ""just a colon cancer thing"" and refused to text me after I learned it was in my family. Because I was old enough that ""It wouldn't change the screening recommendations anyway""

And that's where it sat for 5 years until I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. I pushed for testing again, and mentioned that Lynch was probably responsible, he told me I was wrong about Lynch! I was stunned. Asked him to look it up on UpToDate (basically a medical encyclopedia for medical people to access during work - I work at a hospital that uses it so I'm familiar with it) and he did, during our visit. Apologized and said he'd learn more about Lynch before our next visit.

I then talked with the husband of a friend of mine who does internal medicine in another state and he also didn't know anything about Lynch beyond its connection to colon cancer. 

Lynch is too niche for most PCP I think. Wish I had known that back in 2017 when he told me I didn't need to be tested. Might have avoided my cancer.

AlternativeFair2740,,,"‘I work as a peer supporter, so am I qualified?’ 

Well no - and that’s the problem? 

Women are not encouraged to breastfeed, they’re railroaded into it. Women are not allowed to be given support for formula feeding, or trained in administering formula feeding, by midwives, who are the actual trained people to advise, until a neonate is quite literally starving. Case in point - the feeding schedule noted above will include formula top ups, and still, the ‘perfect’ advice in this thread includes putting this exhausted, scared woman through feeding and then pumping. This lady has medical advice. She needs options that are beyond ‘the benefits’ of breastfeeding, which are status partly and evidentially minimal to none. 
Some vague notes on ‘childhood obesity’ and ‘prevention of cancers’ won’t cut it, especially when used by women who are happy to lecture on ‘evidence’ based practice. The evidence doesn’t exist, and you don’t need a ‘GCSE’ to read beyond shiny, biased leaflets in your doctors surgery, although I would hope that most people would ask for medical advice from someone with more than a level two day course in how to promote breastfeeding/ a GCSE. 

Women feel shit when they inevitably give up breastfeeding, and having the odd person battling through the emotional nonsense by stating repeatedly - formula feeding is fine, and a perfect replacement for breastfeeding, it’s important, regardless of whether they get swamped by women towing the line and shouting their ill informed options online. We need to remember that safe, sanitary bottle feeding ‘coincided’ with a drop in infant mortality from ONE IN THREE babies in the postpartum period. 

Perhaps you could analyse whether being a ‘breastfeeding peer supporter’ is the actual cause of the shame and upset women feel when they take the inevitable decision to stop feeding, rather than some inherent need to breastfeed that has magically appeared in modern times, contrary to the whole history of human praxis.",0,1719843635,,,0,lb4p1m8,t3_1dslhle,t1_lb4lf7z,1719843651,0,False,UKParenting,t5_iygqf

923ai,,,"AI is already being used to develop new treatment types and data storage capabilities in healthcare apps today, and this will advance even more in the future.

One of these AI applications is machine learning, which is being used to develop personalized treatments for cancer patients. AI can analyze a person’s DNA and find mutations that are specific to them. This information allows for development of targeted therapies that are much more effective than traditional treatments. AI is also being used to develop new drugs and it’s estimated that AI will be responsible for developing 50% of all new drugs by 2025.

Another area where AI is being used in healthcare is in the development of digital health assistants. These are AI-powered chatbots that can provide patients with information about their condition, answer basic questions, and even offer emotional support. Digital health assistants are becoming increasingly popular as they can provide 24/7 care and support to patients, even when human doctors are unavailable,

AI is also being used to develop wearable technologies that can monitor a person’s health. These devices can track things like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vitals. Because AI is very good at pattern recognition, medical AI is used to diagnose humans to spot diseases and anomalies in the human body as early as possible. The promise is to get information out of data that humans cannot see with their naked eye.

Everyone has heard about the fantastic stories of AI detecting cancer way earlier than any radiologist could. But these are recorded during perfect data conditions.

EtonRd,,Stage 4 Melanoma patient,"Choosing not to have treatment is a valid choice. It’s an extreme choice with extreme consequences though, and I think it warrants thorough discussion. 

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can. Ultimately, it’s your decision, but it’s a such an important decision that it deserves a lot of conversation and a lot of thought and input from people who love you and input from doctors that deal with these types of decisions every day.",0,1719844160,,,0,lb4qig2,t3_1dsk5wr,t3_1dsk5wr,1719844174,9,False,cancer,t5_2qixx

Vali32,,,">Every system has limitations. 

Yes, but not all limitations are created equal. 

>UHC famously doesn’t pay for expensive drugs and experimental or new treatments. 

I think you have misundersood something. UHC systems do not pay extortionate prices for drugs, but that is not the same as not paying for them. They negotiate prices with the pharmas in what is known as a ""*market*"". If the price is too high, they walk away and come back next year. If the pharmas end up with no sale because they asked too high a price they normally lower it. Meanwhile patients get the second newest treatment. 

The use of the word ""famously"" is peculiar since this is an opinion thats pretty unique to the right wing in the USA.

>This is nothing new. There are literally “death panels” that decide what is worth paying for, and not.

""death panes"" are insurance companies trying to find ways to deny expensive treatments to individuals. They are pretty much **exclusive to America.** Other nations make central purchasing decisions and leave the treatment to the doctor and the patient.

The only first world country where you have an appreciable chance of ending up with no treatment due to a panel decision is the USA.

>What is “medically necessary” is a very vague term. 

The definition is ""*the service/procedure/treatment can be reasonably expected to prevent a condition from occuring, reduce or improve the progress of an illness or condition, or help a person to achieve maksimal functional capacity.*"" The people who decide are normally the patients doctor although with some guidelines, such as previous court decisions or instructins.

>Also, UHC has massive waiting lists for things as simple as a MRI or CT that you can get at basically any hospital in the US in a day.

Nonsense. The US only manages ""average"" in overall waits by special advantages in comparisons, namely not counting the uninsured and not counting waits due to fear of costs.  In general, most first world UHC systems are faster.

The impression that the US is particularily fast is created by people with an agenda cherry picking countries to compare to, in particular the UK that has been starving its system for decades and Canada which is the slowest system out there. Sometimes by cherry picking areas of comparison too, such as MRIs.

>Look at the cancer section for one example. It explicitly talks about refusing for cost:

This is what your own link says about it:

""*According to Cancer Research UK, cancer treatments are usually the same, whether carried out privately or on the NHS.*

*However, it adds that there might be new treatments available privately that are licensed in the UK but haven’t yet been approved for use on the NHS. Some of these won’t receive approval at all either due to not being effective enough compared to existing treatments, not fulfilling the NHS’s value for money criteria, or both.*

*Having such treatments privately will typically cost many thousands of pounds.*

*When the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does decide to approve a treatment for use on the NHS, the NHS has 90 days to make it available.*

*Cancer Research UK’s website points out that while some treatments could increase chances of curing or controlling cancer, some may have very low chances of success, and may come with additional risks.*""

This is also a case of cherry picking the UK, and further cherry picking the US best stat to compare to the UKs worst as if this is some kind of benchmark for UHC. 

Also... this is still **fantastically** much better than in the US. If a new treatment do not fullfill the NHS value criteria, the patient gets the second best treatment. Now this normally only applies to a fraction of new cases. Compared to the US, where 8 % of the population uninsured and with low cances of  getting treatment at all, and a further 8+ % underinsured and with spotty odds. 

Tl: Dr: Having 8 % of the population with no coverage at all is vastly inferior to even the UKs resource starved system. The US outside of a few areas such as seeing specialists lag the average of first world systems and need to compare itself to the slowest ones to feel good. Death panels are a pretty much exclusive US thing.",0,1719844333,,,0,lb4r044,t3_1dmkb18,t1_la220p4,1719844348,2,False,PetPeeves,t5_2qynj

raccoon-nb,,/ᐠ - ˕-マ｡˚ᶻ 𝗓 ,"It's about the cat's health.

Cats don't understand the concept of gender, and therefore having no testicles does not really psychologically effect them. They aren't losing their manliness or anything. Generally, they're running around, acting as normal within half an hour to an hour of the procedure. They don't even know what happened.

Neutering is mostly done for the health benefits.

As the procedure involves the removal of reproductive organs, it eliminates health risks associated with those organs. A neutered male cat will never get testicular cancer. A spayed female cat will never get uterine or ovarian cancer. A spayed female cat will also never have to suffer pyometra (a painful, potentially fatal uterine infection common in older intact female cats).

Changes in hormone levels also decrease the risk of other issues. Neutered male cats are less likely to suffer prostate diseases. Spayed female cats are less likely to develop mammary tumours.

Female cats go into their first heat at an average of 6 months of age, sometimes as young as 4 months of age, and while at that age it could be very dangerous for them to get pregnant (comparable to a human child or teen pregnancy), cats have no knowledge of medical concepts like that, and they breed purely on instinct. Having male and female cats who aren't spayed/neutered may very well lead to pregnancy/birth complications as well as cat overpopulation and hoarding. Cats also have no sense of biological family and do not hesitate to breed with cats they are closely related to, so if intact cats of opposite sex who are related to each other are kept, inbreeding will become a huge problem.

Male unneutered cats do not go through heat cycles but are fertile year-round from the age of 4-8 months. They often go through intense sexual frustration and stress, leading to territorial behaviour. It's not good for their psychological health, and it can lead them to get into fights or wander too far and become ill or injured alone.

It has been found that neutered male cats live an average of 62% longer than unneutered/intact males, and spayed female cats live an average of 39% longer than unspayed/entire females.

It also has a very low rate of complication, and almost never has long-term effects.

For the above reasons, it is strongly recommended by welfare organisations and veterinarians alike to spay/neuter pet cats.

cyrustakem,,,"stop giving money to the cosmetics industry, it's a cancer in society 90% of the times.

I guess i have to admit, a pleasent smelling perfume might work, if used in low quantities, as most women seem to care a lot about smell, well, not just women, everyone dislikes bad smell, but women seem to enjoy good smells more than we do. When i say that, it's not ""rexona v8"", no one wants anyone smelling like motor oil...",0,1719846130,,,0,lb4w77u,t3_1dsosgf,t3_1dsosgf,1719846148,1,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844
jasminenightbloom,,,"Just FYI for OP and anyone with pets, kids or lungs of their own that that filter-grade (versus food grade) DE can cause severe scarring on the lungs by that same mechanism it kills the bugs, inflicting tiny cuts:

From WedMD: “Be extra careful around filter-grade diatomaceous earth. Inhaled crystalline silica particles can build up in your lungs and lymph nodes. Long-term inhalation of diatomaceous earth has been linked to several health conditions, including lung cancer, silicosis, and other respiratory diseases”

Sharikacat,avengers,Avengers,"I wanted less jealous Stormbreaker and more Jane with cancer. The compelling part of Jane being Thor was in her decision to keep being Thor even after realizing that it purged the chemotherapy drugs. Rather than being scared of dealing with the cancer, I would rather have watched Jane be scared to use the hammer. Her scientific mind knows that being Thor is killing her, but she can't get out of the ""with great power"" mindset. That would have been a great movie on it's own, though it could be serviced decently as a B-plot.",0,1719846183,,,0,lb4wct7,t3_1dqxc4m,t3_1dqxc4m,1719846200,1,False,marvelmemes,t5_35mye
