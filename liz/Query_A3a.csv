Green_DREAM-lizards,,,"No. It is your opinion.  Vegans NEED to supplement b12 and many other nutrients and they're still often low. 
There is no plant source of b12 that is bioavalible to humans that we can convert. The shit in soil is a CORRINIOD.
Same with omega 3. Ala doesn't convert like you think.  Look it up. 
There's several like this.  


If you need to supplement , hate to break it to you,  your diet is deficient.  Vegans NEED fortified and enriched food. You need it lol 
It's why 86% of all vegans QUIT. 
It's such an optimal diet,  THAT MOST OF YOU CAN'T KEEP TO IT. It's so optimal, that there's never been a vegan civilisation. Not one.  
 
There is no wfpb vegan vs whole foods based meat diet.  That study doesn't exist. 
You'll find comparisons with the standard Western diet.  But not a wf meat based diet.  


And to be quite Frank, I don't trust nutrition science.  Because time and time again,  they get caught lying,  diddling data,  there's at least 4 or 5 studies on Saturated fat that got buried because they didn't like that it didn't show it caused heart disease or increased death... but knowing you vegans,  you'll pull up an epidemiology study. 


Most nutritional science is self survey or epidemiology.  Which is like throwing a needle into the sea and seeing what sticks. 
Eg. ""People who eat brocoli are less likely to get cancer""
Is it the brocoli? Or do they eat healthy in general? Exercise? Abstain from drugs and alcohol? Have healthy and regular social relationships? Live in areas low in pollution? 


Vegans are still dying of heart disease,  getting diabetes,  being obese,  getting mental illness... elderly vegans are breaking bones more than thier meat eating equivalents.

Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren’t just a moral good because they prevent disease; they’re a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they’re essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

   **Source**: Pinker, S. (2011). *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. Viking.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we’re talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation—traits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate’s last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren’t just about reducing cancer rates—they’re about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let’s face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it’s right to recycle or how to create a more just society. After all, moral truths hiding in plain sight are just waiting for a good peer-reviewed journal to bring them to light.",0,1719802089,,,0,lb2mmwd,t3_1dseqza,t1_lb2la3k,1719802104,3,False,GenZ,t5_2tz25

Darthcookie,,,">>To this day, it is still the best healthcare experience I’ve ever had. Yes the cost was a huge factor in that, but also the level of care and thoroughness of the medical staff was beyond anything I’ve ever experienced.

Private hospital I’m assuming? If not, kudos to Kenya! 

But yeah, that would also be your experience in a good private hospital in Mexico. We do have great doctors and great facilities, my uncle had prostate cancer and his surgeon performed a robot assisted prostectomy and his recovery was great. Hospital was great, it was like staying in a hotel. 

I had surgery in a public hospital and I’d need to write another huge wall of text to explain how different the experience was. The quality of care is good, as good as a private maybe, but if you work in healthcare you know that depends on the team more than the facilities. 

>>I need these medications, but is me buying that medication elsewhere resulting in someone who actually lives in that country and pays taxes to not receive that medication?

Nope, don’t even worry about that. There are general shortages like when COVID hit and everyone and their mother was buying any and all medications that would supposedly help prevent it which was a problem because we have a lot of medication available over the counter. I remember specifically something that was used to treat lupus, can’t remember the name of the medication but the point is, healthy people with means were getting it and some lupus patients had a hard time finding it. 

I had trouble finding what was originally prescribed to be as treatment for latent TB, public hospitals didn’t have it, private pharmacy either so I ended up having to restart treatment. 

But the way things work is by government contracts, the problem arises when there’s not enough money in the budget, the government just being bad at managing things, corruption or meds that go “missing”.

So no, don’t feel guilty for buying cheaper meds here because those go by supply and demand and that’s just capitalism. 

The problem are the pharmaceutical companies and corrupt/inept government officials.

Big_Analyst_8093,,,"Yes, twice. I married my college sweetheart in 1974 and he died in a plane crash in 1979. Fast forward to 1987 and I married my second husband. We’ve been married for 37 years, have two sons and two granddaughters. 

Both of my husbands knew I stuttered, and were ok with it. At both weddings we said our vows in unison. Problem solved. 

If someone loves you, they love all of you… imperfections and all. My second husband told me that one reason he loved me is that I never let my stuttering define my life or my career. I was a university administrator until our sons were 3 and 5, I then earned my masters in education and taught high school literature for almost 20 years. I was upfront with my students that I’d never read aloud, and I had many volunteers to read in every class. I taught stutterers and we always bonded. 

Stuttering has made me more empathetic, kinder and gave me the ability to just say f@&k stuttering. Tens years ago I had a double mastectomy. My husband had a shirt made that said “F*CK CANCER” and underneath it had in tiny letters “(and stuttering!)” 

My thoughts exactly. 
I’m now almost 71. I still stutter. Some days are bad stuttering days, some good.

EXSPFXDOG,,,"I have been on every pain medicine they have,  and the only thing that worked for my pain was methadone. I had a situation where my doctor got tired of having the government looking over his shoulder he just retired! It is getting harder and harder to find pain clinics that will take you anymore, so if you find one, only do things by the book!

My doctor drug tests me every visit, and if you are smoking pot or taking any pain drug he didn't prescribe, he will bounce you out the door
I have seen him kick them out the door! 

I had a situation where I had pain meds for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but nothing for bedtime, so I couldn't sleep at night from the pain! I took methadone for my main pain med and hydrocodone for breakthrough pain. I had to give up the hydrocodone to get two more methadone to take at night! It gave me my life back! I could sleep again!

The government is like a 10,000-pound gorilla, and the amount of pressure they put on pain management doctors is almost unbearable! When they get the feds come in, they take all of their patient records!

That leaves doctors without the ability to know their patients' medicine, dosage, history, etc!

 Most pain patients are not trying to get some kind of buzz or knock themselves out they just want to stop hurting so they can smile every so often and enjoy life again!

It is the people who take handfulls of pain pills to get high that have messed this up for people who need their medicine to live! Oxycontin was made for people who have cancer, and it is timed release, so they don't have to take medicine every 4 hours 24/7!

 The people who take it to get some kind of buzz defeat the timed release built into oxycontin so they get hours' worth of medicine all at once and can overdose and kill themselves! 

It is very dangerous, and they are hurting the cancer patients and chronic pain patients that need these medicines!

In my opinion, it is not a NC law issue, it is a federal law issue. When the politicians make changes in law, they go way overboard. They were seeing overdose deaths going up, and they felt they had to do something, but they don't do anything halfway and don't really consider the people who will be hurt by their new laws and regulations!

Constantly. Since the age of 14, when I started having some tiny symptoms. I was 90 pounds then. I started having horrible migraines, because my heart was working literally overtime. Doctors were stumped. My father didn’t believe me and thought I was faking my symptoms. 

I dealt with the symptoms until I was 26, when I went to the hospital for the 3rd time in less than a week, because I thought I was both having a heart attack and a brain aneurysm at the same time. I was about 110 pounds when wet. While they tried to diagnose me, I actually started to have a heart attack, since my heart rate was 180-200. I was put into a medical coma, they saved my life by causing a pseudo aneurysm in my leg, and putting a ballon pump in my heart. 

I was in that coma for 3 months. They finally found out what was really causing my issues. Cancer! Well two kinds, actually. I had cancerous cells on my thyroid gland, but it was not the only cause, I also had something called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. It caused a tumor, called a pheochromocytoma, to grow on my adrenal gland, and that was the underlying problem. 

Long story short, I was very lucky and had an amazing team of endocrinologists at UCSF. They removed my thyroid, some lymph nodes, and the phyo, and took that adrenal gland with it.

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‘should’ be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn’t a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don’t believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don’t know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I’ll restate that you’re correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can’t chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don’t do those sorts of  things.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

It's moments like the unvaxxed gathering at PorcFest, where EVERYONE had stories about losing jobs, friends, and family members.  Family members that weren't lost to the political division were lost to ""sudden"" deaths and aggressive cancers.  On the car ride out to the Northeast, I texted some friends in NYC while my travel buddy was taking the wheel.  On the way back, I heard from one of those friends that her mom has cancer now.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.  I channeled years of anger, grief, and dark humor into an art installation that fills multiple rooms.  There was enough of those feelings to keep growing it larger and adding more.  I don't know if I'll \*ever\* find closure by doing this project, but at least I'm doing way better than I would be without it.  There's moments where I wonder if it didn't prevent my business partner from offing himself a few times.

PatientNobody9503,,,"Thank you for your insight. I am an introvert, but I can be an extrovert too at times if I'm comfortable enough in a situation. I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

The only reason I want to find other converts is because they have seen a lot of what I have seen likely growing up in the Western world and not being born muslim. While born muslims also have a lot of troubles growing up I just feel like its a bit different in experience, you know?",0,1719807628,,,0,lb2y41v,t3_1dsf8if,t1_lb2s3ow,1719807644,2,False,islam,t5_2qhbp

Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

She said there is nothing she could do and that unless I was feeling pain in all of my joints all over then not to come back. I told her I was frustrated and she said she has prescribed medication before but it doesn't do anything for people like me. She said she would order labs for RA but not to expect anything and even if it was positive then she can't do anything because it's too early, she said to let the labs expire if I felt like it.

  
Well, I took the labs a few weeks later and I had a positive HlA-B27 and found out of a family history of psoriatic arthritis. She called when she got the results and said, actually, I need to see you by Friday and I need to see you every 6 months for the foreseeable future. She didn't want to give me any medication unless I told her I had been having pain for a decade, I have been having unexplained pain for at least that long or longer so she put me on Prednisone.

Professor_Eindackel,,,"All the treatments have negative effects and make no mistake, it may not kill you if you catch it and treat it early, but prostate cancer still really sucks. As for choosing RALP, no way I wanted the chemical castration shots that go with radiation, and besides that radiation also can lead to incontinence and ED like RALP, as well as bowel problems that don’t seem to affect those who choose surgery. From what I have come to understand you experience the surgical side effects but things get better, with radiation the effects come later but you do you not bounce back. Every person is different and every case is different so I would talk to as many people and do as much research as you can. What was right for me may not be right for you.

My sister is a physician and she recommended the nerve-sparing RALP before I even saw my urologist for the biopsy, just in case it was positive. My incontinence lasted about 72 hours after the catheter was out and was very minor. ED is a work in progress. I am barely 5 months out and I was told it takes some time to fully recover from ED, many of the others who chose RALP have told their stories. Even if erections do not fully return there are shots like trimix and bimix, vacuum devices, implants etc. My surgeon uses a nerve monitoring device and he said everything checked out before and after the surgery, and he is very positive about my making a full recovery in every respect. 

Both radiation and RALP have their proponents in the medical field in on this board, you have to talk to your doctors, do your research and choose what is best for you. If I was older I probably would have gone the radiation route but I also like the idea of being able to do radiation if I ever have a biochemical recurrence. If you do radiation first it’s hard to do surgery later because of the tissue damage. It was also a relief to get the prostate out and get good pathology, which confirmed it was all contained, it was all Gleason 3+4 and nothing on the capsule, clean margins all around. So avoiding the chemical castration shot, as well as getting pathology on the gland that took away a lot of my anxiety made surgery well worth it to me.

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

Apparently, my ovaries were unremarkable during surgery, so they left them alone. Now the reality is I felt beforehand that something else was very wrong, my pain didn't match only a uterine stage 1 but I trusted drs. I had a miserable recovery with nothing outwardly wrong but unexplained pain. Horrible shooting pains, especially. I was told to do PT, which was useless. I felt no one was listening to me. I asked my gyn for a CT, which was refused until I finished PT. I ended up in a nasty car accident 10 months post-op, which led to the discovery of 2 large masses on my ovaries. I went thru debulking etc..a lot of testing made the oncologist believe it was a separate cancer because it was also in a setting of endometriosis.

AMCreative,,SAG-AFTRA | TV/Film,"Couldn’t disagree harder. Let’s dissect.

“Look at all of these people who never took a class”

This is a logical fallacy called “Survivor Bias”. Other examples are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never having gone to college.

“I have taken 5 classes and only 1 was decent”

This is a statistical error centered around sample size.

If I told you I had a medication that cured cancer because 5 people took it and 1 went into remission would you trust that pill?

“I could have learned all of these things on my own”

And you should. IMO classes and self-motivated learning are independent tracks. One augments the fruits of the other.

“Long time students with the teacher have no credits”

And? 95% of actors don’t make a living acting. That’s the likelihood of you pulling any actor out of the wind and checking their credits, not just long term actors with a coach.

Further, and you should know this as a business major, acting classes rarely teach explicitly acting business strategy and entrepreneurship. So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren’t regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students… don’t do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher’s fault?

“I’ve had acting coaches tell me I’d never book a co Star then I did”

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

“Coaches don’t want people to be successful because they won’t study anymore”

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You’re not even thinking your arguments through now.

“I’ve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique”

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it’s something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it’s on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

—-

It feels like you’re treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don’t see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it’s always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I’m at the point where, generally, I don’t learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

SpiderCop_NYPD_ARKND,,,"Keyword ""perceived"", as it does none of the above as a part of its modern fiction or intention.

I work in Health Insurance with the ACA, so I'll go over all 3 of those: 

(1) The current ACA doesn't overreach government authority at all. Everything the current ACA does,  it does with existing Government Authority, the two exceptions,  the initial requirement that States expand their Medicaid programs to cover anyone with income at or below the Federal Poverty Level,  was struck down before the law ever took effect in 2014, and the requirement for individuals to have Health Insurance coverage or face a fee on their taxes was reduced to zero in 2018 (though this actually did more harm than good,  see 1A).

(1A) The requirement for private individuals to have coverage or face a fine was actually a cost saving measure. By having a many people covered as possible, they increased the pool of premiums paid in, which is the pool used to pay out claims. By removing that requirement and shrinking that pool, Insurance providers (companies) have had to raise premiums to keep up with the increased numbers and costs of claims from expanded access. All insurance uses this pool & pay system, good drivers car insurance is used to pay the claims of accident prone drivers. People who live in places with good weathers home insurance premiums are used to pay claims of people who live in tornado alley or in coastal areas with hurricanes. Healthy peoples health insurance premiums were already used to pay for sick people's claims. All removing the requirement for was shrink the pool and make it more expensive for everyone. Which has just exacerbated the cost increases to be addressed in point 2.

(2) Cost is something difficult to understand,  so I'm going to get into how costs have increased as a result of the ACA to help people understand that it really isn't the ACAs fault. To start,  it must be understood that *access* to Healthcare is different than *having* Healthcare. Access to Healthcare is having insurance and doctors/hospitals/pharmacy services (providers) that take that insurance that you could choose to use. Healthcare is the services those providers, well, provide. The ACA is there to provide access,  not Healthcare.  It helps people get and afford insurance. It does not,  however, educate or hire new doctors, specialists or, pharmacists, build new hospitals or doctors offices,  or otherwise increase the number of providers available. So, basic supply and demand applies,  if you increase the number of people with access (demand) but don't increase the number of providers (supply), what happens is basic economics,  the suppliers raise prices. These people are in are also more expensive to treat,  which I'll cover in 2A. *However*, things don't stop there.  With increased demand,  supply always tries to expand to meet it. But with specialized services like Healthcare,  that takes time.  If fast food demand goes up,  you can train a thousand new fry cooks in a week if the labor pool is there, but it takes upwards of a decade to become a general practice doctor, longer to become a specialist. Supply hasn't had enough time to answer the increase in demand yet. Further, people having access to and using Healthcare will in the long run reduce costs,  because someone who can go get that funny feeling checked out and catches their cancer at stage 1 is cheaper and easier to treat than that same person without access who let's it faster into they end up in the ER and discover it at stage 4, but that also takes decades to happen. How do we know all this? Because we've seen it happen in dozens of nations that instituted single payer systems in the latter half of the 20th century.  The same patterns played out every time,  an initial huge spike in costs, followed by a gradual decline as demand expanded and general public beauty improved. We're just happen to still be in the spike.

(2A) There's also the fact that the ACA eliminated the ability of Insurance Companies to discriminate against the people most in need of coverage,  people with preexisting conditions. If you had something like arthritis,  and you had a gap in coverage (for whatever reason) longer than a certain period,  *if* you got renewed coverage (they could also simply refuse your business entirely) insurance used to be able to just tell you you were out of luck regarding coverage of your arthritis because it was preexisting with a period where it was unmanaged. Sucked for you,  but it saved the insatiable company money (and thus,  saved those they would cover money since they weren't paying premiums to cover those claims). The ACA made it so that they have to cover you and can't charge you more for having preexisting conditions.

(3) I've actually already covered the effect on private insurance really, those who previously already had coverage are now competing with ACA coverage recipients for a limited supply of provider services, so they're seeking the price increases as well as having harder times getting appointments.

But all of it,  all of this,  is secondary effects and side effects of *trying to fix what was fundamentally a broken system*, a system designed to  cover healthy people and fuck over everyone who actually needed Healthcare. Working in this field, the people who I hear complain about it,  are the ones who were benefiting from that system as it was before,  healthy or well off people who had insurance before the changes and didn't get shafted by it at the time who are bitching about the fact that the system is working to cover people it wouldn't before and that's making things (momentarily, as I've explained above) more expensive.",0,1719853101,,,0,lb5hc8p,t3_1dswbj3,t1_lb54utl,1719853119,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i

goldenphotog,,,"Oh man, I hate that. I can’t say much for the recurring dreams part because this was a one-time thing if I remember. I’m going to paste a response I made to someone else because I think it would apply to you, and I’ll also add that nipples can shrivel up at even very slight stimulation so unless it looked so weird to the point where your breast looks dented or something I wouldn’t worry much about the shriveling. Here’s what I had said previously to someone:

I’m so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I’ve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery— they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn’t see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She’s not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it’s something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it’s really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day.

BigPeteFlvcko,,,"After my Dad passed away when I was 12 (he had a tough 2 year fight against cancer), his family told my Mom that they never trusted her and she ""stole"" my Dad from them. Mind you, we lived 20 minutes away from them and moved back to Houston so we can be closer to my Dad's side when I was 3. It all felt out of nowhere, and left my Mom by herself, as her family lived 6 hours away. It was tough watching my Mom make so many sacrifices, professionally and personally, to take care of my younger brother and I, all while, my Dad's family sat in their house 20 minutes away and couldn't lift a finger for us anymore. I'm 27 now, and it's still hard to think of his side of the family at all without a ton of anger and frustration. The hardest part for me, for the longest time, was trying to figure out a reason for their sudden change of heart, but I've come to the realization, that not everyone has rational, healthy thoughts. It sucks that when I lost my Dad, I essentially lost his whole side of the family, but at this point they can kick rocks for all I care.

I am a long time cancer patient, there were years I spent a half of them in the hospitals. I literally see year after year how the quality of service deteriorates. I'm lucky I found a few doctors that they know what's what. I thought every doctor is at that level. This year basically gave me a wakeup call. 

A doctor being in government advisory board doesn't know what insulin does. A mental health doctor that commented my long term depression and suicide attempt with ""it's not that bad, you still came to see me, so you are fine . See ya in 3 months"". Another mental health doctor prescribed me a medication that cannot be prescribed with my existing ones. I barely survived it. Another time - I couldn't breathe due to COVID. I was taken to medical assessment unit, provided with oxygen and a doctor said to not worry, they will get me sorted. Then consultant came , said I had a heart attack 5 years ago and that's my problem (I didn't. I had my LAD stented, though). He totally ignored lung damage visible on X-ray, the first doctor was looking at him with ""unbelievable"" face. And consultant prescribed me heart medicine that almost killed me and sent me to cardiac clinic in 3 months, where the doctor said that he is just general, he has no idea about cardiac stuff and I look ok for him. I fainted a minute later. 
Another visit - endocrinologist said that from endocrinology point of view I'm perfectly fine. My thyroid was destroyed by radiation. My insulin level was 40 times higher than normal. I don't produce testosterone (I'm a male) and my pituitary gland requires  a lot of stimulation to even start responding. I fainted and fallen down during that appointment as well.

Street_Hedgehog_9595,cath,Catholic,"To win, you need to make it your number one goal to put God first. I might sound harsh, but you need to be actually serious about this. If this were some competition to win 1,000,000 dollars if you didn't have sex again before marriage, do you think you'd do better? If yes, then you have a lot of work to do. And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that  the doctors who have no  interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.  With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list  and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.  It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.  The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.  The LDN tablets she was taking  were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.  Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.  My own medical cabinet is quite empty now! 



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and  residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.

Dijon2017,,,"I’m sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient’s and cancer’s responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It’s not clear how “the nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit”. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an “aggressive” type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient’s subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient’s cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it’s entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother’s complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don’t how to explain this info, but here’s something. 

I have a different ailment, that I’ve found great success with , and I’m coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it’s conditionally essential. In children it’s much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It’s also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it’s top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn’t scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn’t scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone’s comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‘autoimmune’ diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it’s called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it’s implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in “global protein metabolism” when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability.

I’m a male in my mid 50’s and there is no one my age who hasn’t been affected by breast cancer - be it themselves, family, or close friends. My mom went through stage 4A a few decades ago when I was too young to understand the gravitas of the situation.  I was living half a world away (left home at 17, got the news when I was around 22).  She protected me from the full truth - as moms do. I thought a mastectomy would  take care of everything. Had I known the reality of the chemo, radiation, surgeries, I would have come back home to offer whatever pitiful support I could. It wasn’t until some of my close friends went through similar situations that she opened up to me on how hard it really was. 

I wish I had something soothing,or poignant to say, but I don’t. The only advice I can give is to trust your family and friends - let them know how hard it is and if they’re willing to help LET THEM - and don’t feel guilty about it.

But on reflection, that was my attitude and outlook concerning _homo sapiens_ in general: fear, mistrust, and resentment  toward nearly the entire species.  Talk about bigotry!!!

(One of my highly favored AA speakers, one Charlie/Charles C. from Burbank/Camarillo seems to usually include something early in his talks, ""_I really don't think very highly of us as a **species** ..._"" and he says the word ""species"" with a bit of a _spit_ in his intonation - the dude's hilarious.)

Hopefully, I haven't lost all prudent wariness about people in general (we are all, to some extent, capable of actions that range from gracious, to untoward, to the utterly heinous) but running around with obsessive dread is surely no way to live!

I thank God (even though I'm still stubbornly agnostic) for that 4^th Step fears inventory!

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I’m making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I’ve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I’m in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60’s. I’d like to think that I’ve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo’s, one 14yo). It’s all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it’s a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won’t really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we’d have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we’ve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I’m very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don’t particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I’ve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I’ve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life…I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what’s the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They’ll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they’d have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

Are you taking Electrolytes? It takes a while for you body to adjust to the diet as it's been fueled on Sugar/ carbs. There's many people out there that give great advice. We as a species weren't designed to be powered by Sugar, the most addictive substance in the world. Sure it will sustain you just as my ancestors lived/ survived on Potatoes. Extra Sugar turns straight to fat, but they were active and didn't have the calories available to get fat. 
Big Food is the biggest pusher of sugar, why do you think they put it in EVERYTHING? That's what dealers do, get people addicted to their products for Profit and silence the competition. 
Big food and pharma own the politicians and they will not tolerate anyone that challenges that monopoly. That's the reason they are going after the""Quacks"" that promote keto and carnivore diets, natural medicines and taking a holistic approach. They actively shadow ban anyone that won't comply as they are all in it together. 

Rockefeller started the American cancer society to do just that after his oil based ' medicine "" started giving people, you guessed it, CANCER. HE sponsored the medical community and flooded it with his henchmen to keep his profits flowing. Anyone that bucked the system was immediately labeled a quack and ostracized so voices were silenced. 


We are being played by the system, a system that pushes pills that treats but doesn't cure. They spend billions on advertising money that will be better spent on research. 

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

Well no - and that’s the problem? 

Women are not encouraged to breastfeed, they’re railroaded into it. Women are not allowed to be given support for formula feeding, or trained in administering formula feeding, by midwives, who are the actual trained people to advise, until a neonate is quite literally starving. Case in point - the feeding schedule noted above will include formula top ups, and still, the ‘perfect’ advice in this thread includes putting this exhausted, scared woman through feeding and then pumping. This lady has medical advice. She needs options that are beyond ‘the benefits’ of breastfeeding, which are status partly and evidentially minimal to none. 
Some vague notes on ‘childhood obesity’ and ‘prevention of cancers’ won’t cut it, especially when used by women who are happy to lecture on ‘evidence’ based practice. The evidence doesn’t exist, and you don’t need a ‘GCSE’ to read beyond shiny, biased leaflets in your doctors surgery, although I would hope that most people would ask for medical advice from someone with more than a level two day course in how to promote breastfeeding/ a GCSE. 

Women feel shit when they inevitably give up breastfeeding, and having the odd person battling through the emotional nonsense by stating repeatedly - formula feeding is fine, and a perfect replacement for breastfeeding, it’s important, regardless of whether they get swamped by women towing the line and shouting their ill informed options online. We need to remember that safe, sanitary bottle feeding ‘coincided’ with a drop in infant mortality from ONE IN THREE babies in the postpartum period. 

Perhaps you could analyse whether being a ‘breastfeeding peer supporter’ is the actual cause of the shame and upset women feel when they take the inevitable decision to stop feeding, rather than some inherent need to breastfeed that has magically appeared in modern times, contrary to the whole history of human praxis.",0,1719843635,,,0,lb4p1m8,t3_1dslhle,t1_lb4lf7z,1719843651,0,False,UKParenting,t5_iygqf
AlricaNeshama,,,"😂🤣

Not laughing at you, OP.
Laughing at how ACCURATE you are. 

Because.... I AM THE RESULTS of doctor NEGLECT! 

I was 16 years old when I got this disease and absolutely NO ONE even knew what it was. 
I was out on birth control because they had NO CLUE what to do. 

I did NOT get a formal PCOS diagnosis until I was THIRTY THREE (33) years old. 

I was having ALL of my reproductive organs removed BEFORE I turned 35.
Because of.... CANCER! 

PCOS doesn't cause pain? 

Sure! 
Shall we go through the checklist of MEDICAL CONDITIONS PCOS CAUSES! 

Sleep Apnea 
Acid reflux disease 
Lymphedema 
Diabetes 
Dental damage
Bone weakness
Cancer

What does sleep apnea do? 
Oh, it only CAUSES YOUR HEART TO SLOW DOWN! Which can cause PARTS OF YOUR HEART TO NOT WORK RIGHT! 

Acid reflux disease? That comes with a hiatal hernia and a SPLIT DIAPHRAGM! 

Lymphedema. Has ANYONE here experienced leg swelling so bad that the pores in your leg start RAINING LIKE A FAUCET down their leg. 
I have. It was EXTREMELY PAINFUL. 

Diabetes. This? Oh, this only leads to KIDNEY DEATH! 

Diabetes is the ONLY disease on this list I DON'T have. 
Why? 
I watched my father DIE FROM THIS! 
He became diabetic and after 30 years his KIDNEYS DIED! 
Resulting in the last 6 years of his life to be on KIDNEY DIALYSIS! 3 days a week. FOR LIFE! 
Until it CAUSED HIS HEART TO NOT FUNCTION RIGHT! And NEEDED a pacemaker and that STILL DID NOT WORK!
BLOOD POISONING!
Frequent trips to get the port for dialysis fixed because it kept clogging up.
It LITERALLY KILLS YOU!

PCOS DESTROYS Dentin. IE Teeth! 

Bone? PCOS weakens bone. 
To the point they are EASILY BROKEN! 

And one of my favorite topics. 
Cancer. 

NO one ""gets"" cancer because EVERYONE is born with cancer. 
Cancer is antigens that is literally part of the bodies DNA. 
Example.:
Uterine cancer is also known as marker CA 125.

Every type of cancer has a marker and they can mutate and become cancer at any given time. 

Been down this road and literally waiting for breast cancer to show up. 
Just so I can CHOP THEM OFF! 

I know all this because from 33 to 36 I had a REAL OBGYN and she taught me everything. 
Then my insurance changed and I could no longer see her. 

I have NOT had an OB since. But. I also have NO reproductive organs to concern myself with. 

I am the RESULT of YEARS of NEGLECT! 

This is what UNTREATED PCOS LEADS TO! 

A LIFE of medical disability and PAIN! 
Oh, and I am ONLY 46.

And ... Studies have PROVEN that PCOS leads to an EARLY DEATH! 
Meaning WE DIE sooner. 

And the goddamn doctors are LAYING IN THEIR AZZES. Still treating us as if it's some big goddamn JOKE! 

There is ONLY so much I can have removed or cut off before I literally limit my life to being stuck confined to a bed. 

Sorry, I get very into explaining this disease because I have LIVED with it since 16 and SUFFERED until a doctor FINALLY took me seriously. 
It was only SEVENTEEN years TOO LATE! 

And now, I am so sick EVERY DAY! 
The acid reflux disease is SO BAD it's in the entire lining of my stomach. 

I CAN'T take any medication orally because my stomach WON'T allow it

923ai,,,"AI is already being used to develop new treatment types and data storage capabilities in healthcare apps today, and this will advance even more in the future.

One of these AI applications is machine learning, which is being used to develop personalized treatments for cancer patients. AI can analyze a person’s DNA and find mutations that are specific to them. This information allows for development of targeted therapies that are much more effective than traditional treatments. AI is also being used to develop new drugs and it’s estimated that AI will be responsible for developing 50% of all new drugs by 2025.

Another area where AI is being used in healthcare is in the development of digital health assistants. These are AI-powered chatbots that can provide patients with information about their condition, answer basic questions, and even offer emotional support. Digital health assistants are becoming increasingly popular as they can provide 24/7 care and support to patients, even when human doctors are unavailable,

AI is also being used to develop wearable technologies that can monitor a person’s health. These devices can track things like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vitals. Because AI is very good at pattern recognition, medical AI is used to diagnose humans to spot diseases and anomalies in the human body as early as possible. The promise is to get information out of data that humans cannot see with their naked eye.

Everyone has heard about the fantastic stories of AI detecting cancer way earlier than any radiologist could. But these are recorded during perfect data conditions.

EtonRd,,Stage 4 Melanoma patient,"Choosing not to have treatment is a valid choice. It’s an extreme choice with extreme consequences though, and I think it warrants thorough discussion. 

For a lot of people with stage four cancer, probably for most of us, we will never be cured. But we can be treated and we might be here for years. Cancer can be, but that doesn’t mean it’s untreatable. 

I know that small lung cancer is a particularly brutal type of cancer and I’m sure that is a factor in your decision.

My advice is to get a referral to a palliative care doctor that is associated with your cancer center or hospital. This is a doctor that focuses on quality of life and they can help you understand what your life could be like if you underwent treatment and the possible time you could get from treatment. And they should also be able to talk to you about what will happen if you choose not to have treatment and how your disease will progress. And what can be done to keep you comfortable during that time.

They could talk to you about what time would be like when you are receiving hospice care. What are your options and where will you receive care and who would your primary caretakers be? These are all things that you need to think about if you choose not to have treatment.

Talk to the people closest to you, the ones you think can handle this discussion because not everybody can.

So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father’s situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister’s college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn’t have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn’t happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn’t respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she’s “poor” and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop “holding her tuition over her head”. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever “pay me back” nor have I ever “held it over her head”. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn’t realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she’s still young. She once again didn’t reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It’s a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn’t replying to my texts and I’m just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn’t from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

BigRedDoggyDawg,,,"I'll start by saying I upvoted your post. And 100 percent good for you, it is excellent that you broke down a lot of barriers to get someone to say, ""hey doc this time it's bad"". Also I personally never have a go at anyone for decisions they make in an austere environment, most people can have a sane pros and cons discussion and reflect on it. Take away a practice that might be different to yours but still tempered by yours. Anyone who isn't that sensible is unlikely to respond to you because you are meaner. Makes no sense, I have no time for people who approach supervising ED juniors that way. They are incivility, and they kill patients and doctors with their stupidity. 

Some devils advocacy. 

At a certain level in the pulmonary tree there is disagreement between specialist world wide radiologists as to what is and is not pulmonary embolism 

At a certain level we don't and can't know who benefits from life long anti coagulation. Some provocations are unknown and so are their disappearance. 

There is a probability which frankly I'm not well read enough to quantify, though I imagine it's not large, that CTPA all chest pains without say ECG signs of right heart strain, echo findings, HD instability etc. Picks up 'ghost' PE and starts life long anti coagulation. 

Let's go further. PE is a high mortality condition. True. Is that understanding from big PEs, yes. We probably miss PEs all the time, it is probably a spectrum condition that could be less fatal than we think. 

Now let me add in another wrinkle, breakthrough PE exists, the diagnosis of PE is probably made much harder when someone is anti coagulated. 

Put all of this together. Is it wise to do a CTPA without a significant pre test probability? Does it condemn a patient to an imaginary radiological diagnosis, give them the risks of being anti coagulated and then make the diagnosis of a break through PE some 10 years later when they have cancer much much harder.

hyphenomicon,,,"I got it from my life. Over the course of two years, right after I was getting my life in good shape after cancer and becoming interesting to women, I was sexually harassed by a diversity hire who didn't do any work, falsely accused of breaking into a sorority girl's home as her way of retaliating for telling her I thought she was manipulative and I didn't trust her enough to go to her house (I still have no idea where it is or was), which included a literal fake crime scene and report to the police, and finally targeted by a psychopath who used feminism to get positions of power from which she could prey on others in cons and scams via a rumor campaign that cost me scholarships, employment positions, the esteem of someone I cared deeply for, tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly got me kicked out of school. I have a PTSD diagnosis from this and suffer from extremely bad hypervigilance related to social interaction as a result. I am terrified of other human beings now.


Feminists have used me for sex while feigning friendship, promised me honesty and help with my high-functioning autism while lying and manipulating me, spread untrue rumors alleging I'm schizophrenic after I trusted them with knowledge of my disability (definitely not, no symptoms, currently receiving mental health care and my provider has confirmed my reasoning and perceptions are sound), denied me the opportunity to speak in my own defense, gaslit me, offered help and withdrawn it, body shamed me about a million different times, emotionally abused me, told me I was dangerous for reporting attempts of others to hurt me, lied about my behavior in the pursuit of petty grudges, encouraged dangerous women to girlboss by destroying other people, punished me for reporting literal crimes, and discouraged friends from listening when I was suffering and desperately needed someone to talk to.


Feminist books are great. The PR is wonderful. Feminist people treat men like shit. The best of you are apathetic. The worst of you are vampires for whom the ability to hurt men is a perk. There is zero policing against abusive women who use the movement as a source of justifications for hurting others, you simply deny it ever happens instead.


Women who are dangerous people target those who are vulnerable who others will not believe or care about if they report wrongdoing. Actual feminism encourages women not to believe or care about men who report wrongdoing.

MeanMugginMin,,,"TL;DR- My recovery has been pretty smooth, honestly. I had a rough go before, maybe that's why it seems easy-ish.  

Had a radical open procedure with vertical cut. I was bleeding to death. 3 ER trips. I had a D&C, unfortunately, that made my body decide to clot up (but not stop bleeding of course!) I developed a saddle PE and 2 DVTs in my leg. My local hospital decided to take the PE out, as it was going to kill me if they did not. They also did a uterine artery embolization while I was under to staunch the bleeding hopefully and gave me 5 units of blood. They didn't have gyn/onc available, so they were trying to transfer me to mine, an hour away. That hospital rejected me. My gyn/onc was down in LA for the holidays (Thanksgiving) and unavailable. They tried UCSF. They said no, because my D&C was clear of cancer. Last minute at 1am, Stanford had a free bed. So my hospital put me in an ambulance at 1am for a 4 to 5 hour drive. Super! It was late November, I was in only a gown, and the ambulance heater was broken. (I am THAT lucky!) I did get there alive however! Stanford tried to stabilize me, topped up my tank with another unit of blood, and set to figuring out wtf was wrong with me. They tested the shit out of me for 5 days. I was beginning to wonder if I was just a guinea pig. It sucked because I was utterly alone. Far from home and no friends or family near. On day 4.5 it was grim, because I wasn't getting stable enough for the hysto I needed. Another unit of blood given.  At 6am on day 5, I sneezed. Something popped and I started gushing blood. I called the nurse. She looked and was shook. She grabbed her phone and started taking pictures of my crotch to send to the doctors. By 9am I was being wheeled to the OR, and told that I may not make it, it was very risky, but I had no other choice. Cue me uncontrollable sobbing. My little sister saved the day and drove my mom the 5 hour trip up to be there just before my surgery. Only one day though.

I woke up! I don't remember much! I had cancer confirmed. I spent 5 days in-patient after surgery and then took a transport ambulance home.....super not fun to ride that long with a giant open belly wound!  I slept in a recliner (still do) I'm almost 7 months post op.  I don't get around that great, but I should mention that before all this crap, I survived a stroke(Yeah, my body is out to get me!) It left me paralyzed on my left side. I was/am still learning to walk again. My bitch uterus set me back real far! I can walk, but not well or far. I move like I'm really drunk all the time. 

 After all that shit, yeah recovery was ok. I had pain...omg did I. But it was from the thrombectomy procedure a few days before the hysto. It was in my leg! My belly hurt if I sneezed or laughed or whatnot, but it was tolerable.

You buy bread, it's not bread. It's bread+; it's enriched white flour, cellulose from soybeans or corn, salt, high fructose corn syrup, highly processed soybean oil, stabilizers, soy lecithin, and additional proteins from soybean or gluten.  

People are eating highly processed foods, so even if they're cooking they're using convenience items like cream of soup cans or powder mixes. Or frozen fried foods.

Do not shave your dogs fur- the fur doesn’t “take” nutrients- in fact a body will naturally let hair and skin suffer and go without in order to provide nutrients to systems that are critical to staying alive- like the heart, lungs and digestive system. Shaving its fur will only make it vulnerable- you said it is hot there- many dogs have double coats specifically to insulate them from cold AND heat and shaving them will make them unable to regulate their body temperature. 

Your dog may have something as minor as parasites or as serious as cancer- but it absolutely must have veterinary treatment or it will almost definitely die. Again, if you tell us where you live, people will help you find a way to treat the dog. 

Veterinary treatment costs money, because like doctors, vets have to go to medical school, and it takes years of training and a lot of money. What your parents may think is extortion is simply the cost it takes to get that training couple with what it takes to run a business and profit enough to survive most likely. And vets are not psychic- they cannot tell what is wrong with an animal without doing tests- they can only guess. 

People in many countries will go into debt in order to provide their dogs with medical care, so it is difficult to hear that your parents, who are not even struggling financially, simply do not want to use their money to help this dog. I understand there are probably cultural differences, but it is obvious that YOU love the dog so clearly caring enough to spend money on an animal isn’t entirely unheard of there.

I had the distinct impression that if they don't find cancer or something similar they really don't care and are resistant to investigate possibilities without being pressured. I also think they confuse probability with certainty and because maybe the majority of patients have ""functional"" problems (i.e. the doctor has no idea what's going on) they default to that as a diagnosis and will refer to a psychiatrist so they don't have to deal with it. Personally I think it would be prudent to check on the status of the erosions with another endoscopy and make sure they've not worsened.

Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.

I would try and push for the PET and possibly the colonoscopy asap, is it possible to get another opinion too? I think it sounds very important to try and get treatment started soon. Hopefully the further testing might give them some answers as to what treatment to start on. 

My mum was initially diagnosed with bone metastasis, and with her they never found a primary either. Unfortunately for her, the bone and bone marrow biopsies never showed any cancer cells, so she got moved around from doctor to doctor having multiple tests, endoscopy, colonoscopy, PET scans, bone scans, CT’s, but they never found it. It was 9 months of this with no answers or treatment. It was only when she developed fluid around her heart that they found cancer cells, most likely from GI tract.

My mum passed 3 months after they finally found the cancer in the fluid, as she had to have heart surgery and never really recovered from that. From what I have read, if she had started chemo (she was meant to start on CAPOX and immunotherapy) back when it all first started I think she could have got a lot more time with us and quality of life. 

Sorry, I didn’t want to write all of that to scare you, just so you know you are not alone and to encourage you to push for faster treatment than my mum got. She needs to get treatment and soon. They may not ever find the primary, but I truly hope they, do just don’t let them drag it out for months without doing anything.

I know how hard it is to get answers when they can’t find a primary, i feel like i am still searching for answers.

GoldfishChronicle,,,"This is related, but not the same. I hope it can help you anyways. I was the close friend/girlfriend (13 yrs) of a man with terminal colorectal cancer; my own father passed away in 2021 from prostate cancer. His son was in the final year of his degree when he was admitted to emergency surgery for removal of the blockage in his bowels, it was the first any one of us knew of his condition. We only knew he had been unwell but the doctors thought it might be colitis and they were still testing when things rapidly fell apart. 

Truth be told in the hospital, his son was in shock, so young to be confronted with such a situation. He was concerned with how he would balance his job, relationship and school. He looked like he wanted to run away, back to normalcy; I didn't blame him. But I admit to feeling a little frustrated, because of my own experience I know the guilt that arises after, despite the fact that I was with my own father every step of the way... I was worried he would regret his actions and words at that time. But I am not him, and he is not me, so held my tongue. He ended up completing his final year and graduating. His father passed away just weeks before graduation. He made it to say goodbye.

While my loved one was sick, he would save his energy to mask his pain and worries in front of his son. After recovering from the first surgery, I told him, he should reserve his time for his son, he needed to rely on his son, his son needed to feel needed, to know that he helped in a meaningful way, or else he might pay the price later on. Not quit school, but to be confided in, or asked to help every so often. Not fully sheltered. I don't know if he took the information to heart. 

What I do know is this: You could have been in the same room as your mother, day in and day out and still feel guilty. The brain looks for the cause, it wants to know how to avoid the pain again, it wants the source. It will play tricks on you, having you rethink things over and over again. A child is meant to diverge from the path of their parent at some point, lead their own life, separate, but together in spirit. They didn't want to break your path, ""even if I cannot go forward, they can"". This was her wish, she didn't want you to suffer then, even though she can't save you from it now. That was her choice, you can be angry if you don't like it, because valuable information was withheld from you. That is fair. 

Your path was meant to move away from them at some point, the death feels very different when your path was tied to walking with the departed as a life partner; be gentle with your father. You lost the same person, but you are grieving different relationships. You can tell him you don't want to be kept in the dark ever again, and tell him how it has affected you when you are both ready. Anger is normal, it will pass. You will want to fight something, anyone, anything, when you are not reconciled to what has happened. (I am guilty of this too.)

Your mother set out to protect you for as long as possible... She did her job. You did what she wanted you to do. Over time forgive yourself, and just know she loved you very much. She was probably content with you out of the storm and yet worried for you all at once. Be angry, be sad, feel guilty, feel numb, but do not despair. Do not lose hope or the courage to move forward later, when you slowly regain your strength. She did not want you to stagnate, do not forsake her wish. Be an example for your father, he will be lonely, let him know you still have each other. Let him know you still want him to witness your accomplishments and want him there to tell you he is proud. Let him know there is still life after loss, even if it doesn't feel that there will be ever again. It probably feels really unfair that he is almost making you be the strong one. Let the adult part of you listen carefully to your inner child who is rampaging and inconsolable right now. Don't admonish them, they've just suffered a catastrophic loss, their whole world is changed, be soft with them, let them have a few free passes, one day, the tears will be less and less frequent. Life will be different, but the sun will come out again.

Be kind to yourself, this hurt takes time to scar over. Don't rush, be patient. You will heal. (I'm so sorry this is so long, I am grieving too and I tend to ramble when I am sad and introspective.)",0,1719829348,,,0,lb3usm9,t3_1dsogs2,t3_1dsogs2,1719829365,4,False,grief,t5_2s369

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

White-tigress,,,"Ok.  SO.  Long one incoming but it WILL answer your question and the answer is yes.  

Oh but Tigress, you ask, how could you POSSIBLY know?  

Well, dear friend,  I was in medical weight management programs for 8 years, eating 600 to 800 calories a day and less than 40 carbs with no weight loss at all.  By no weight loss I mean, it was a surprise when I dropped 1 pounds over a full 6 months. PLUS I was on 3 weight loss medication, including one of the supposed miracle GLP1.  And yes I did say YEARS.  8 YEARS.  In the middle of this time I moved to a new city and had to start over with a new doctor who had to document all over again nothing working.  Once he got there, he then spent, I am not joking here, 3 years sending me to doctors for tests.  ALL THE F*ING TESTS.  I call it 3 years of hell.  Hormone, blood, nutritional, scopes, biopsies, swallow, sleep, swallow with radiation for 5 hours, sonogram, CT, neurological, insulin, anemia, and bacteria or parasite.  I was at the hospital 3 or 4 days a week either doing an intake, doing a test, or getting the results of a test.  Every test came back normal.  Every.  Last.  Test. Except one in my stomach for a common virus call H. Pylori that it took months and 3 rounds of such caustic antibiotics to cure that I have PTSD from taking them.  They took me 3 months to recover from taking the antibiotics.  But that had no bearing on the weight loss it was a side quest!! At this point he decides I must have a tumor.  I am so depressed I can’t lose weight and in pain and exhausted from tests I am actually begging to have cancer because I just need an answer.  Remember, we are almost a decade in.  So they send me to a CT scan with contrast dye (where they blow out my veins several times) and and MRI both.  Guess what!!!  Both are clear.  No cysts or tumors.  No cancer.  I should be happy but I sobbed.  Finally, having exhausted all other tests, he says he can run a genetic panel,  looking for markers of obesity or genetic disorders.  Ironically, it was the ONLY test that wasn’t painful and exhausting.  

To say, when that test came back with a rare genetic mutation, I was overwhelmed with emotions, is the understatement of understatements.  Then to find out it kills most people in birth, and those that survive die in or before puberty, was staggering.  I still get letters from genetic laboratories asking if they can study me.  

So, my doctor says my only hope is bariatric surgery.  I say “but nothing else worked.  How can this?”  So I put off the referral to surgery for 8 months to do research. I have a genetic mutation nothing else touched.  I better know my shot before I take it.

Turns out it works for lots of reasons.  It is not just restriction.   

It cuts the nerves in the stomach completely turning off and resetting metabolism, like rebooting a computer.  When it comes back online in your brain it has changed what it needs, the speed it metabolizes, the hormones and amounts of them it generates, etc.  it’s a complete system reboot.  If you get a bypass there is the added layer of removing the pancreas and gall bladder from the direct route of food digestion.  This makes less confusion and it’s easier for them to work and make proper amounts of insulin and enzymes and bring the body back into balance.  This is already long so I won’t continue but I spent 8 MONTHS deep studying how surgery could over ride something like a genetic mutation, when nothing else even touched it.  And it KILLS most people!!

Well I am typing this 2 years post surgery.  I am down to 130 pounds and have even already had insurance covered skin removal.  I’m still recovering from it.  I have not weighed this little since I was 10.

I_reddit_like_this,,:snoo_hearteyes: Permanent Resident,"Health care here is generally good and affordable when paying out of pocket. Specialist doctors generally charge about $800 pesos for an exam and diagnostics, and medicines are also very inexpensive. Unless you have cancer or a complicated medical condition, it's usually feasible to pay for services out of pocket. However, insurance is still recommended for emergencies and future medical needs.

Private insurance is the best option. My wife and I are in our 50s, and I just renewed our policy, paying $92,000 pesos for the year with a $31,000 deductible and 10% copay per condition (no deductible for emergencies/accidents). This policy also includes $100,000 USD coverage outside of Mexico.

The next best option is IMSS, which is run by the government and can be purchased by people with residency. The level of IMSS care can vary widely from hospital to hospital; the ones in larger cities are generally better, but I've heard many horror stories about substandard care.

Seguro Popular/INSABI is the lowest level of healthcare.  It's free and available to everyone. It is a last resort for those without money

Painfree123,,,"It's only natural that gout sufferers focus on preventing, or at least relieving, the pain of gout flares, and our doctors oblige. But after 15 years of gout pain, followed by 20 years of study, it has become clear to me that the pain of gout is an unignorable warning of something seriously amiss in our bodies, something which often has much graver consequences than joint pain. Just preventing the pain is equivalent to disabling the alarm of gout pain.

The cause of most gout is the frequent prolonged episodes of lack of breathing with lack of oxygen during sleep, known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is grossly underdiagnosed and is why most gout flares start during sleep. The episodes of reduced oxygen cause every cell in the body to abruptly produce excess uric acid, as well as slow its removal by reduced kidney function, leading to the precipitation of the urate crystals which cause gout when they form in a joint of someone who is genetically predisposed to gout. If OSA continues for too long, it will lead to many life-threatening diseases (eg. cardiovascular diseases, stroke, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, cancer) and premature death, which has also been found to occur in gout patients, whether or not their flares are well controlled by diet and medications like allopurinol. Resolving OSA early enough will greatly reduce your risk for developing these diseases, and will prevent further overnight gout flares. See a sleep physician and get tested for OSA, and follow strictly the recommended procedure to resolve it. Gout is your early warning alarm!

I agree with your mom about not starting allopurinol at your young age. If medication is your only treatment, allopurinol will be lifelong for full benefit, although your lifespan will probably be shortened by gout's life-threatening comorbidities. But she is not right about dietary changes making much difference.

unBnnBle1,,,"I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer at 16 years old, the same year both my parents were killed in a car accident. I spent the next six years living with my reclusive Hungarian grandfather who worked in the death camps cleaning the showers. He was a drunk and would tell me haunting stories about his time there.

During this period of my life, I would make friends with people in the cancer ward only to see them die. Over and over.

Around this time, living in NYC, I was sitting in an ambulette in Manhattan when two planes struck the world trade centers. Bodies fell all around me exploding on the pavement and drenching the vehicle with blood and brains.

I can still hear their screams.

My grandfather shot himself after the attack and I discovered him moments before his death. I remember him holding my hands and looking at me with a terrifying intensity. He said that death was everywhere and inescapable and he was sure he'd be in hell soon.

My very next doctors appointment they realized that due to a clerical error, I had been misdiagnosed and was in perfect health, minus the harm the radiation had wrought on my body.

Given a new lease on life, I sought solace in drugs and spiritually. I attended a retreat in the redwood forests where I did heroic doses of LSD and DMT. Communing with entities unstuck from time and the corporeal body, I learned the secrets of the universe and spoke with death. I saw my grandfather burning in hell and bodies flying upwards off the pavement and back into flaming towers. I saw my cancer and all disease, I saw the masquerade of life as if truly is.

And in that moment, I willed into myself the elimination of fear and acceptance of my mortality. The entities told me the truth about life and death. That while we are immortal beings, our souls carry the scars of our time on Earth through all eternity and only through acts of virtue can they be mended.

Since then, I have dedicated myself to enlightening others.

To that end, I sell books on Amazon teaching people the secrets of living a heroic life, free from fear and pain.
