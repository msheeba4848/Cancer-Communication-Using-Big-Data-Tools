Green_DREAM-lizards,,,"No. It is your opinion.  Vegans NEED to supplement b12 and many other nutrients and they're still often low. 
There is no plant source of b12 that is bioavalible to humans that we can convert. The shit in soil is a CORRINIOD.
Same with omega 3. Ala doesn't convert like you think.  Look it up. 
There's several like this.  


If you need to supplement , hate to break it to you,  your diet is deficient.  Vegans NEED fortified and enriched food. You need it lol 
It's why 86% of all vegans QUIT. 
It's such an optimal diet,  THAT MOST OF YOU CAN'T KEEP TO IT. It's so optimal, that there's never been a vegan civilisation. Not one.  
 
There is no wfpb vegan vs whole foods based meat diet.  That study doesn't exist. 
You'll find comparisons with the standard Western diet.  But not a wf meat based diet.  


And to be quite Frank, I don't trust nutrition science.  Because time and time again,  they get caught lying,  diddling data,  there's at least 4 or 5 studies on Saturated fat that got buried because they didn't like that it didn't show it caused heart disease or increased death... but knowing you vegans,  you'll pull up an epidemiology study. 


Most nutritional science is self survey or epidemiology.  Which is like throwing a needle into the sea and seeing what sticks. 
Eg. ""People who eat brocoli are less likely to get cancer""
Is it the brocoli? Or do they eat healthy in general? Exercise? Abstain from drugs and alcohol? Have healthy and regular social relationships? Live in areas low in pollution? 


Vegans are still dying of heart disease,  getting diabetes,  being obese,  getting mental illness... elderly vegans are breaking bones more than thier meat eating equivalents. 


You'll never convince me that veganism is healthy.  Because I've seen for myself it isn't.  Most vegans quit and they look like shit tbh. The kids look malnourished and Grey...",0,1719801632,,,0,lb2llds,t3_1dppdgz,t1_lb1hbzu,1719801647,1,False,exvegans,t5_109235
Low-Addendum9282,,,"Science has long been our go-to for unraveling the mysteries of the universe, from the inner workings of atoms to the vast expanses of space. But can it also answer moral questions? Absolutely. 

The Rational Basis for Morality

1. **Objective Reality of Well-being**: Science, the grand arbiter of objective truths, can assess the conditions that foster human flourishing. Consider the laughably obvious connection between health and well-being. Vaccines, for instance, aren’t just a moral good because they prevent disease; they’re a scientific marvel that improves our quality of life. If we accept that fewer diseases are better, then we can scientifically determine that promoting vaccinations is a moral imperative.

   **Source**: Harris, S. (2010). *The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values*. 

Clearly, debating the morality of preventing polio is on par with arguing whether gravity really pulls us down.

Empirical Measurement of Happiness

2. **Quantifying Happiness**: Believe it or not, those pesky scientists have found ways to measure happiness and suffering. Psychological studies use surveys, brain imaging, and even hormone levels to gauge how different actions and policies affect human well-being. So, when policymakers use scientific data to maximize societal happiness, they’re essentially engaging in a moral exercise.

   **Source**: Diener, E., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2002). Very happy people. *Psychological Science*, 13(1), 81-84.

Who knew that moral truths could be found in a lab, right next to the beakers and Bunsen burners?

Moral Progress Through Science

3. **Evolving Standards**: Science evolves, and so can our understanding of morality. Take slavery, for example. Once a ""cultural norm,"" it's now universally condemned. How did we get there? Enlightenment thinkers, armed with scientific reasoning, argued against the dehumanization inherent in slavery. Their work laid the groundwork for moral progress, guided by rationality and empirical evidence.

   **Source**: Pinker, S. (2011). *The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*. Viking.

Sure, it might take centuries, but hey, we’re talking about the species that took 200,000 years to figure out indoor plumbing. Patience is a virtue!

Neuroscience and Morality

4. **Brain Science and Ethics**: Neuroscience has shown us that our brains are wired for empathy, fairness, and cooperation—traits that underpin many moral values. By understanding the neural basis of these traits, we can better understand why certain actions are deemed moral or immoral and create environments that foster ethical behavior.

   **Source**: Churchland, P. S. (2011). *Braintrust: What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality*. Princeton University Press.

So, if you ever wondered why you feel guilty stealing your roommate’s last slice of pizza, blame your overactive anterior cingulate cortex.

The Science of Societal Well-being

5. **Public Health and Policy**: Public health policies based on scientific research often reflect moral decisions. For instance, smoking bans in public places aren’t just about reducing cancer rates—they’re about protecting people from harm, a clear moral objective.

   **Source**: Gostin, L. O. (2000). Public health law in a new century: part II: public health powers and limits. *JAMA*, 283(22), 2979-2984.

Because, obviously, it takes a Ph.D. to conclude that clean air is better than secondhand smoke.

Conclusion: The Scientific Moral Compass

In conclusion, science is not just a tool for understanding the natural world; it can also guide our moral compass. By objectively assessing the consequences of actions on human well-being, quantifying happiness, understanding our neural predispositions, and using empirical data to shape policies, science offers a robust framework for answering moral questions.

Of course, there will always be skeptics who insist that science should stick to test tubes and leave moralizing to philosophers and theologians. But let’s face it: if science can land a rover on Mars, surely it can help us figure out whether it’s right to recycle or how to create a more just society. After all, moral truths hiding in plain sight are just waiting for a good peer-reviewed journal to bring them to light.",0,1719802089,,,0,lb2mmwd,t3_1dseqza,t1_lb2la3k,1719802104,3,False,GenZ,t5_2tz25

SonomaChef24,,,"Well if it makes you feel better, I’m naturally skinny because of my cancer, that caused my thyroid to over produce hormones that made my body think I was running a marathon. Constantly. Since the age of 14, when I started having some tiny symptoms. I was 90 pounds then. I started having horrible migraines, because my heart was working literally overtime. Doctors were stumped. My father didn’t believe me and thought I was faking my symptoms. 

I dealt with the symptoms until I was 26, when I went to the hospital for the 3rd time in less than a week, because I thought I was both having a heart attack and a brain aneurysm at the same time. I was about 110 pounds when wet. While they tried to diagnose me, I actually started to have a heart attack, since my heart rate was 180-200. I was put into a medical coma, they saved my life by causing a pseudo aneurysm in my leg, and putting a ballon pump in my heart. 

I was in that coma for 3 months. They finally found out what was really causing my issues. Cancer! Well two kinds, actually. I had cancerous cells on my thyroid gland, but it was not the only cause, I also had something called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. It caused a tumor, called a pheochromocytoma, to grow on my adrenal gland, and that was the underlying problem. 

Long story short, I was very lucky and had an amazing team of endocrinologists at UCSF. They removed my thyroid, some lymph nodes, and the phyo, and took that adrenal gland with it. I’ve since recovered and am in remission. It could rear its head again, but for now I’m ok. I still only weight 130, but I am slowly gaining weight. I struggle with appetite.

NoRoyal2270,,,"I have to admit, that’s the best point I’ve seen anybody make on it. And I will concede that for the most part your correct. Government has become too large and too pervasive within our society. As well as nobody should come between you and your doctor. 

With that first part said, if that doctor knowingly gave you cancer, or cut off your healthy functioning ear. That doctor should be dealt with as a criminal. Accidents happen however we do the same with car accidents, if you kill or maim someone as a result of a car accident, you can be treated as a criminal. 

The idea that a man can become a woman; or that the man feels as if he ‘should’ be a woman, stems from a mental Illness. His psychology is not functioning in a healthy manner. Putting him through a surgery will not help him, for the problem is within the mind not the body. 

We already have the agencies in place. there isn’t a reason to creat another one of give more power to the government. The criminality of malpractice has already been established for a long time. We wouldnt be putting restrictions on adults other than the doctors responsible for the surgeries. The children and adults who have already been victimized would be given the proper therapy necessary. It would be wrong to force them to take any more hormones in a attempt to make them closer to their original form. 

Privatization I don’t believe would be an issue. If cutting off functioning organs or prescribing hormones that we don’t know the long term side effects of is illegal, private surgeons will not be an issue. 

I’ll restate that you’re correct on the government control. The government has no right to tell you that you can’t chop your cock off. However the idea that a person would want to cut up his body or remove functioning organs is a very clear sign that something is wrong. Healthy people don’t do those sorts of  things. It would be disgusting to trust a person with anorexia when they say they’re overweight. The same goes for men and women who believe they can change their sex. We can’t.

Secure-Dare3782,,,"We sent our vet a cake large enough for the whole office with a card after one of my pups needed to have an eye removed due to juvenile glaucoma.

My pug pups are about 10 months old now. We brought them home toward the end of last year because I was struggling severely with depression after losing my closest family member to cancer. These puppies saved my life absolutely. Finding out that one of them was in severe pain and would need the eye removed was almost like I was losing my family all over again. I was visibly distraught at the vets office and couldn’t hold it back. Both boys lifted me up so much after the death that I couldn’t stand the thought that one of them was in excruciating pain.

This woman really is amazing. She assured me that he was going to be just fine and to just trust her. Well, Greyson has been the happiest little boy since having it removed a few months ago. Most people don’t even realize the eye isn’t there unless they get really close. She even spent extra time matching the “wrinkles” pugs have on each side so that he still looked completely symmetrical. He is adorable and I truly believe he could not be happier.

CrossdressTimelady,,,"Oh god, where to begin unpacking this one.  
  
It's sometimes in the small details.  Driving from northern New Hampshire back to South Dakota and just noticing how oddly expensive supplies are along the way.  ""How did I just pay $15 for an energy drink and one of those little travel-sized packets of antacids that have like 1-2 doses in them?  Really?  $15?  That seems like a lot even at a rest stop.  How did buying one meal at Wendy's and splitting it just cost me $20?  Why isn't anything in the motel room working properly?""  Those are the boring details.

The more interesting small details that just feel a little ""off"", like the old world was traded out for a new and slightly shittier model while we were all knocked unconscious are things like, ""why does this small town in Pennsylvania look totally abandoned?  None of the houses have lights on.  Somehow it's darker than rural South Dakota out here.  There's no signs of life anywhere... oh shit, this town lost about half its population after 2020.  We're basically driving through a ghost town.""  It's meeting up with my business partner who just spent the week in New York City instead of driving across the country like I did and hearing about how all of his normally successful friends can't find work-- and neither could he.  How he saw one of my close friends that I met while working on TV and film in the Before Times, and how she couldn't find a job either-- the film sets are closed.  It's the moment when he showed her pictures of ""Out of Lockstep"" and she teared up-- even though it was pictures of the funny part and she was very pro-mandate in 2021.  The really strange details are things like hearing from my dad about how he tracks the crime rates in Rochester NY like they're the weather report now-- he needs to know how bad it is before deciding to go out for the day.

The ""no return to normal"" is in details like realizing after I left a week-long Liberty festival that I finally got to spend a week socializing the same way I did in the Before Times-- entering conversations with a certain level of trust and expectation that people understand you-- and then leaving at the end and realizing that I won't have that again until I can set my art installation up again somewhere else and inspire those kinds of interactions again, and now this is like my sacred calling in life to basically run the COVID lockdown version of the Traveling 9/11 Memorial.  Once people walk through Out of Lockstep, it's like a switch goes off in their brain that allows them to be vulnerable in their conversations again.  The friend who revived me when I drank way, way too much in the summer of 2020 was pro-lockdown until she saw that exhibit.  Until I use this exhibit to unlock the closed-off parts of people's minds around me, I can never hope to come anywhere close to the sense of belonging I had in the Before Times.

It's moments like the unvaxxed gathering at PorcFest, where EVERYONE had stories about losing jobs, friends, and family members.  Family members that weren't lost to the political division were lost to ""sudden"" deaths and aggressive cancers.  On the car ride out to the Northeast, I texted some friends in NYC while my travel buddy was taking the wheel.  On the way back, I heard from one of those friends that her mom has cancer now.

The fact that I \*have\* what people at PorcFest referred to as ""The Covid Museum"" says it all.  I channeled years of anger, grief, and dark humor into an art installation that fills multiple rooms.  There was enough of those feelings to keep growing it larger and adding more.  I don't know if I'll \*ever\* find closure by doing this project, but at least I'm doing way better than I would be without it.

I was the ringleader to my high school friend group so I have it somewhere in me. After high school, I became more of a hardcore introvert after coming back to the US (I went to an international school abroad) so coming back was kind of difficult for me socially as my old high school friends here in the US (the one I was ringleader to) basically all stopped talking to me. One friend said I wasn't ""fun anymore"" after coming back. I left the US because my mom and stepdad ended up separating. He cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with his child (my half brother). I was the one who found out and told my mom and everything basically imploded at that time. My grandma died of cancer that same year. It was difficult so I left the country to finish school elsewhere hence my changed mood and all coming back. He was a terrible man, my stepdad. He was forefront to the emotional abuse in my family and some physical abuse as well to me (not my mom or brothers, just me.)

The girl he cheated with was only a year older than me. I was 16. It all hit me hard really. I never even knew my bio dad because he's in prison for aggravated assult on a minor (also me.)

I feel like these things just don't happen as often within muslim families because of Islam. I feel like sometimes people or even other muslims may view me as someone who ""wasn't raised right"" because of a lack of a good father figure..

I just don't know how to talk to people anymore in person. Even my family ties are strained between me and my mom (who pushed me to commitsuicide once as a teen), as well as my older brother who would physically abuse me as a child.

First and last real time I drank alcohol I was raped. I didn't even really realize it at the time because I was so into the western media I thought it was cool I had first had sex. It was hard to get over what happened, really... 

I turned to Islam and want to be a better person and also lead a better life. I want to have children who are good muslims and have a good heart. I want to make friends, but socially and emotionally I'm a bit broken. I have a hard time trusting people and their good intentions.

For health reasons I cannot drive, nor will never be able to drive. So, I have to take the trains. I wouldn’t mind because I like the environmental aspect of public transport, but the smoke causes me to wish so much that I could drive. I cannot drive due to seizures and other things, but at the same time cannot go a day in public without relatively heavy medication due to other people’s smoking. I suffer from migraines, and have to barter which days I can take the medicine on, as it cannot be used every day, or you get medication overuse headaches.

allemm,,,"I have a port. It's my second one. First one I had to get because the chemo I was on is too hard on the veins to put through the arm (as you mentioned).  Since your wife is only having 4 infusions, I suspect she is on a chemo that must be administered via an artery rather than a vein. That is just a guess, but I can't see the docs pushing your wife to get one for only four infusions unless it was truly needed. Is she on the ""red devil"" (doxorubicin)? If so, that would explain the port. 

They removed my first one when I was done treatment, but when the cancer spread and I learned I would have cancer and be in treatment for the rest of my life I requested a new port as I know now how much easier it makes my life.

Street_Hedgehog_9595,cath,Catholic,"To win, you need to make it your number one goal to put God first. I might sound harsh, but you need to be actually serious about this. If this were some competition to win 1,000,000 dollars if you didn't have sex again before marriage, do you think you'd do better? If yes, then you have a lot of work to do. And take it seriously, not ""oh yes! I will do this.. tomorrow!"" 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. ""

Have you heard of the Rosary? It is an incredible prayer that helps us grow in worship of God, I cannot recommend it enough and I would love to help you with it if you haven't! 

Practically, fasting and exercise are very helpful I've heard.

Breathing_inandout,,,"That study is 6 years old which makes it ""pretty old"" in the medical world, especially when light years of LDN experience has occurred since the pandemic began and its use with Long Covid.



There is SO much medical information out there that never makes it to publication ( which takes years) that doctors share among themselves, especially at academic institutions. So, in Northern CA, Stanford, UCDavis and UCSF specialists are constantly in touch with each other with regard to patient experience.



Unfortunately, this means that  the doctors who have no  interaction with academic physicians get left behind and why CME (continuing medical education).



There are many medical issues that become ""common knowledge"" to doctors, but they forget to share that information with their patients ( and with local community doctors who are always welcome to attend conferences at these medical campuses, but never have time).



And the most important data of all is actual patient experience. An issue is only rare until more data is collected and people report it.  With time, ( often too late and in retrospect), something rare becomes common.



Drug safety always refers to side effects first and foremost.



Drug interactions are much lower down the list  and ends up being a rapid fire sentence at the end of those drug commercials.



As far as drugs go, LDN is a safe drug, safer than any drug I know and that includes many vitamins, herbals and over the counter medications.  It's so safe that the UCD primary care doctors strongly encourage their patients to try it! And many LDN prescribers take it themselves to delay inflammaging which delays malignancy as well.



LDN is a drug that helps your body make more of your OWN endorphins.  The only drawback is the liver issue which excludes alcoholics and liver failure patients. Opioid addicts were excluded until recently when ULTRA low dose Naltrexone was compounded and has become a HUGE fighting tool in the Opioid Crisis.



As for the patient with inherited fast acting liver enzymes, her LDN prescription was changed to sublingual because that route completely bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood vessels under the tongue directly to the brain to pump out more endorphins.  The LDN tablets she was taking  were flying in and out of her body, not giving her enough time to go through the process and kick out more endorphins.



As far as starting many NEW drugs at the same time, that's not a good idea.  Of course, in some situations like medical emergencies and cancer treatment require a blast of drugs.



However, if a patient develops side effects, the clinician will NOT know which drug was responsible and it ends being a process of elimination.



And yes, many patients who start LDN are on other drugs, especially those with multiple autoimmune disorders. If you read the newly released LDN book ""New Horizons"", you will see many patients who were able to stop most if not all those other drugs as they reached their LDN maintenance dose.  My own medical cabinet is quite empty now! 



I hope this helps.



There is a reason why medical school and  residency programs take years and years and it's still NOT enough. Doctors are constantly trying to keep up. So, it's helpful when a patient can bring in information like the 2024 LDN guidelines from the LDN research trust website.

Dijon2017,,,"I’m sorry that your mother, you and your family are going through your current experience(s). The treatment of cancer and the patient’s and cancer’s responses to treatment is complicated and highly variable.

As has been mentioned, It’s not clear how “the nurses at the old location would check/monitor the tumor progress at each visit”. How did the nurses do this exactly? Were they measuring the size of the tumor through breast US or some other way? In the vast majority of cancer patients undergoing treatment, diagnostic imaging/testing is usually used to monitor the cancer at planned intervals (like before the initiation of a treatment plan and after the completion of the treatment regimen) or as needed if new health issues/concerns arise.

There are many different types of breast cancer, some being more aggressive than others. What type of breast cancer does your mom have? Do you know her clinical stage?

Cancer can be a formidable beast that can progress/evolve (especially if an “aggressive” type) while the patient is undergoing treatment or the cancer can regress/be killed off. It is usually when the doctors have the ability to discuss the objective measures (scans, possible tumors markers, physical exam findings, blood tests, etc.) that take into account the patient’s subjective concerns/complaints/reports, that the next best management approach is best able to be identified and the next step in management determined.

There are different reasons why surgery for cancer is not always the next best step. In some cases it could be related to the patient’s cancer, current health/other comorbidities that could put their health at risk by attempting surgery. In some cases it could be that the cancer has spread, metastasized and the goal is to use medical management and systemic treatment/therapy to see if the patient can become a more appropriate candidate for surgery. There are time when surgery, radiation and/or systemic therapy are used for symptom control/relief and not necessarily to completely eradicate the cancer in it’s entirety. Again, being diagnosed with cancer and being treated for cancer is complicated. For some patients, things can change in an instant due to their physical health and/or the results of scans/testing.

In all fairness, I think the most important thing is to find an oncologist/cancer center your mom (and you/your family) trust. If in the US, you can find [NCI-Designated Cancer Centers](https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers/find) who should be able to review your mother’s complete medical records and provide her with the best options that address her particular concerns and the circumstances as they are related to her cancer diagnosis/treatment.

Do you think that those whopping 800 studies (that 22 scientists from ten different countries evaluated) didn’t take fresh and unprocessed meat into consideration? And whether it’s fresh and unprocessed or not, they are converted the same in your gut.

“Our previous studies in humans have established that red but not white meat stimulates endogenous intestinal N-nitrosation and that there is a dose response.

3nderslime,,,"Basically : it’s impossible for the politicians to keep up to date on all the subject they legislate on, or to pass laws that are consistently up to date and specific enough to effectively regulate industries. This is why we have agencies, like the FDA, FAA, OSHA, etc. so that Congress can pass more broad and ""vague"" laws, such as ""don’t put carcinogenics in food"", while the agencies, who are staffed by scientists , lawyers and other experts in their fields can decide on the definitions of carcinogenics, classifying which substances are carcinogenics, determining how to test for carcinogenics in foods, and enforce the law, etc.

Agencies are important because they are a lot more flexible and a lot less restrained than Congress is, which allows them to react very quickly to new developments in their specific field of competence, and because they are compromised of people who have a lot of experience in specific fields, unlike politicians who need to have a broader understanding of as many subjects as possible.

However, they are criticized for the little oversight elected officials have on them, and many people perceive them to be self serving.

Under chevron, courts had to defer to the agencies expertise when it came to interpreting the law, as long as said interpretation was judged reasonable. That made it very hard for corporations to contest fines or orders made to them from those agencies.

Now, with chevron overturned, corporations will be able to take agencies to court over the regulations imposed by agencies, and it will be up to the juges to determine whether or not to enforce the regulations.

For example, imagine a generic beer manufacturer invents a new compound, lets call it Betamine, that allows to make processing the beer 5c cheaper for each can they sell. However, after testing, the FDA finds that ingesting betamine has a high chance of causing cancer when ingested, and that beer manufacturer's processes leaves a lot of Betamine in the final product.

Under Chevron, the FDA was free to ban the usage of Betamine in beer manufacturing, and there would be little else for beer manufacturer to do but comply, as they would have very little legal standing to contest the new regulation.

But now, with Chevron gone, beer manufacturer would be free to sue the FDA, and could argue in court that Betamine was never mentioned by the ""don’t put carcinogenics in food"" law, nor was it ever classified as a carcinogenic before the FDA's new regulation, and there it is perfectly legal to put Betamine in food, and also is beer even a food product in the first place?


And if a court was to rule in beer manufacturer's favor, there would be very little the FDA could do to stop them from putting Betamine in beer, or any other corporation under their jurisdiction for that matter.",0,1719794769,,,0,lb25apj,t3_1dqkviv,t1_laowd3x,1719794787,1,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63

What are Telomeres? they are chromosomal proteins that cap off the ends of your double helix.

Ok why do i care about them? they are part of the reason you die, directly effect cellular degeneration. Which is why we die, doesnt actually have to be that way though... everytime your cells multiply they become a bit less, this is also how cancer forms, in a way...

what does that have to do with the Annunaki? Genetic manipulation, a ""man made"" change has been done to this structure, twice just on the end.
1 of which you might not notice if you are already deep in it, also known as the God Gene/worship gene, Scientifically known as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 or VMAT2. it is the reason why people are so attuned to following, religious beliefs and religious experiences, submissivness. The theory is that ancient other wordly travelers used the same genetic manipulation that we have learned today to make us more acceptable to rule, obediant, etc. Also like i mentioned lifespan, now limited to 100-120 years from what it was said to be which is closer to 125000-250000 years as the Annunaki were said to have lived. They made us weaker, more susceptible to illness, pain, fatigue, etc.  Im sure i dont need to say that these changes are not natural and not evolution, thatd be the opposite of it.... tortoises live longer than you...just to name one... a turtle dude... they can live to 150 easy ...SMH 😆 i continue anyway

So only 7% (exact number) of our DNA is unique to humans, just 1.5% is unique to our species and shared with everyone. Where did any other bits come from if not evolution..?

What this all suggests is the missin link isnt the ""God of the Gaps"" its Ultrahuman intervention.
Someone did something and we are looking at the result, most simply said.

Ahisgewaya,no-knight,Agnostic Atheist,"When I first became an atheist, there were two thoughts (fears really) running through my head. One was that I would lose my family. It took a long time but eventually they accepted me (and some of them even became atheists themselves). Eventually I am sure that is how things will turn out for you.

The second one was terror at the concept of non-existence. I channeled that fear into life extension research, which I still do and still think is very important, but I also studied physics, neuroscience and consciousness. 

You may not believe what I am about to say and that's okay, but I wish someone had told me this at the time: anything that can happen will happen according to the laws of physics. You clearly can happen or you wouldn't have been here to type that post. 

There are only so many permutations of matter possible, and one of those permutations is you. That means eons from now, you will exist again, as will anyone else you have ever met. You won't remember any of this current life, but that really doesn't matter. Nothing is lost to the universe when you die. 

As to cancer, that is caused by changes (mutations) to genes that control cell growth and division. It is an unfortunate part of being able to heal yourself (among other things). There will come a day soon when cancer is no longer a problem (very soon in fact, since all you need is to correct the error in the faulty genes, which is something scientists like myself are currently working on).",0,1719798274,,,0,lb2dpst,t3_1dsbfnn,t3_1dsbfnn,1719798292,2,False,atheism,t5_2qh2p

Hypaingeas,,,"Ok don’t how to explain this info, but here’s something. 

I have a different ailment, that I’ve found great success with , and I’m coming back here because a piece along the way helped me understand the amino acid Taurine. 

Taurine is a sulfonic amino acid where most amino acids are carbon based. Typically taurine is synthesized in the body from methionine or cysteine. You can say it’s conditionally essential. In children it’s much lower because they lack the ability to synthesize iut which is a huge part of it existing in breast milk. It’s also found in the heart making up 50% of the amino profile of the heart. When you block the enzyme TauT which shuttles taurine out of plasma into tissue ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Like it’s top 10 disease you can think occur in mice that have this exerted on them. Cardio/Neuro/Metabolic/Retinal Hepatic. 
Basically DIRECTLY causes mitochondrial dysfunction.

It acts as anti-oxidant, but doesn’t scavenge ROS. It actually blocks the production of peroxide in the mitochondria. So it doesn’t scavenge end products of oxidative stress, it completely disables superoxide production. 

What led me to connect it to long covid was someone’s comment about the vaccine on a YouTube short. I work in pharmacy and have seen the whole thing from the beginning, kind of go back and forth, but it always rubbed me the wrong way that it messes with mRNA. So do viruses and cancer and in some ‘autoimmune’ diseases. 

When I was reading the paper on Taurine one of the main things it said about Taurine is its role as a constituent of mitochondrial transfer RNA. Basically messenger RNA produce a codon (which is the first three letters/nucleotides) and then transfer RNA produce a complementary codon (separate three sequence) it’s called an ANTI codon. 

Transfer RNA is created by Taurine derived mutation and allows the protein synthesis of the mitochondria to happen properly. Please just trust me on this, protein synthesis is a vital part of how your cells make energy and maintain homeostasis. In this case mutations are good, and they are only occurring so that mRNA can be recognized (coded for) by tRNA (which is the second step of protein synthesis) and produce the proteins needed for the mitochondrial process in which it’s implicated. When Uridine (which is the compound of tRNA that mutates) remains unmodified the codons are not recognized and therefore not synthesized and this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The paper I was reading referred to the phenomenon specifically as an improvement in “global protein metabolism” when supplemented.

Supplementation also increases this taurine modification of Uridine. 

Viruses mess up lipid metabolism which dually affects cell membrane permeability, and signaling around process involved in energy production. Taurine also has other identified effects on Calcium homeostasis, and calcium basically controls cell permeability. 

It came to me almost like a soft impulse. I googled LONG COVID TAURINE and the first thing that comes up is this, 

https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2023/10/researchers-identify-amino-acid-that-may-play-key-role-for-predicting-treating-long-covid.html.

I mean taurine isn’t even in the title. There’s something here, it’s super cheap to supplement. Studies have shown use of up to 6g a day. It’s in red meat. It’s in breast milk. I also has lots of other effects and is knock out for cardiovascular health. Just take it, let the community know how it went. This could be promising and if you’re wondering why they didn’t think of this sooner, it’s very recently this mechanism of taurine is new found.",0,1719798659,,,0,lb2eml0,t3_1dsbyo2,t3_1dsbyo2,1719798676,2,False,covidlonghaulers,t5_2wizt3

Some overall past negative experiences have tainted his view on doctors and modern medicine, I can't blame him for his apprehension, but the skepticism has to stop somewhere, and common sense should prevail. 

To be clear, I'm not looking for alternatives to replace modern medicine, I'm looking for success stories or ideas of alternatives to assist modern medicine. For example, surely there must be things to avoid in diet. Conversely, there may be foods to double up on. 

For example, Paul Stamets, one of the world's leading mycologist, had tremendous success in helping his mom treat her late stage breast cancer diagnosis with turkey tail mushrooms. Reishi and cordyceps have also shown signs of effectiveness against cancer and leukemia specifically. 

There's research happening with sound frequencies used in potentially breaking down tumors. It's quite fascinating and worth keeping an eye on.

I lost my father to Cancer 15 yrs ago. It began with prostate and spread over his entire body.  It ravaged his body quickly. My brothers case, with his CLL, is different, but not my first experience with cancer in the family.

AMCreative,,SAG-AFTRA | TV/Film,"Couldn’t disagree harder. Let’s dissect.

“Look at all of these people who never took a class”

This is a logical fallacy called “Survivor Bias”. Other examples are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs never having gone to college.

“I have taken 5 classes and only 1 was decent”

This is a statistical error centered around sample size.

If I told you I had a medication that cured cancer because 5 people took it and 1 went into remission would you trust that pill?

“I could have learned all of these things on my own”

And you should. IMO classes and self-motivated learning are independent tracks. One augments the fruits of the other.

“Long time students with the teacher have no credits”

And? 95% of actors don’t make a living acting. That’s the likelihood of you pulling any actor out of the wind and checking their credits, not just long term actors with a coach.

Further, and you should know this as a business major, acting classes rarely teach explicitly acting business strategy and entrepreneurship. So skills like marketing, networking, leadership, strategy, etc, aren’t regularly a part of a classes curriculum (though it does appear in an ad hoc manner).

Lastly, as someone who has taught a class, most students… don’t do the homework. Seriously.

Should that be the teacher’s fault?

“I’ve had acting coaches tell me I’d never book a co Star then I did”

Yeah I agree with you that that person sucks. Coaches should be inspiring and motivational and help you reach new heights.

“Coaches don’t want people to be successful because they won’t study anymore”

Such a highly cynical take. Use your business background to disprove it yourself. Hell read your last paragraph. A successful visible student is a marketing opportunity, which begets more business, full stop.

You’re not even thinking your arguments through now.

“I’ve been on sets where a director fired an actor for using a technique”

Then that actor may not have been ready.

There are definitely some situations where an actors technique can put them in a hole (it’s something I am highly aware of when I do mentor brand new people), but it’s on the actor to know when to peel back or try something different, not the coach.

—-

It feels like you’re treating acting classes like there is only one true way, and you should be treating it like Bruce Lee treated martial arts dojos: take from a class till you don’t see what you can learn from them, and move on. Develop your actor version of Jeet Kun Do.

For me it’s always been that or a lab, where I go to test and hone my skill. I’m at the point where, generally, I don’t learn much or get notes back on my performances, no matter who the teacher is, but the activity of being around peers and continuing to practice my craft weekly with others is useful on its own.

Here’s what I had said previously to someone:

I’m so sorry you had a dream like mine. It really freaked me out and I’ve just tried to block it out to this day. So I (23F) did end up getting a bilateral breast ultrasound at a local midwifery— they have a private Ultrasonographer come in monthly to perform ultrasounds, and her services include breast ultrasound. She was absolutely a godsend and actually took the time to explain the anatomy of my breasts to me. She didn’t see anything alarming, just a LOT of dense areas, one of them being the spot on my breast that really alarmed me and prompted my dream.

My results were BIRADS-2, so no lesions of concern but dense tissue, so she recommended that I start screening in my upper 20s with thermography or ultrasound. She’s not huge on mammograms at a younger age unless it’s something that may be malignant, and I really respected her whole approach to breast health and health in general.

Long story short, if it’s really troubling you, get the ultrasound or some type of screening. I know that itching can sometimes indicate cancer based on anecdotal reports, so it honestly may be wise for you to get checked out. I personally know of 4 women in our small community who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their 20s or 30s. One is dead with 2 children left behind, one of whom still struggles to cope to this day.

theipaper,,Verified Media Outlet,"In response to the report, the Government said it was making tackling ransomware a priority in an effort to raise the cyber resilience of the UK, and its critical national infrastructure. It pledged further investment and to work with industry and international partners to pursue criminal groups who conduct attacks.

The Government claims to have spent over £338m on increasing the resilience of NHS systems to protect it from hacks, and in 2023 launched the UK’s Cyber Strategy to set minimum standards of cyber security to help defend critical infrastructure.

In the recent NHS hack, Qilin, which has been held responsible and has a record of attempting to extort money, stole information covering 300 million patient interactions, including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer. The attack led to the cancellation of more than 1,000 operations and 2,000 appointments.

The group later published a tranche of highly sensitive NHS records into the public domain last Friday, after failing to receive a ransom payment.

Following a detailed security briefing with European investigators, and interviews with UK sources, i revealed on Wednesday that Qilin is merely one arm of a much wider web of hacking affiliates, using servers based in Russia to carry out attacks on UK critical infrastructure.

Hackers enjoy safe haven in Russia, from where they carry out ransomware attacks, so long as they do not cross red lines or cause too much diplomatic uproar, i has been told. And the recent attack on the NHS has been seen as a “major escalation” of the Kremlin’s use of cyber warfare, according to investigators, whose work i was given exclusive access to.

Internal messages between the Russian hackers, seen by i, show them asking a higher authority from the group’s leadership for permission to attack specific targets in the UK on previous occasions.

Until June, attacks on other nation’s healthcare services which could potentially lead to casualties were seen as “off limits” by the Kremlin. But the assault on NHS provider Synnovis on 3 June represents a loosening of the reins, leading to national security concerns among Western intelligence agencies.

Three UK sources warned that the country could face more attacks on critical national infrastructure which could disrupt services, meddle with democracy, and threaten lives.

“The Kremlin has lifted a block on UK targets it once thought were a step too far,” a UK intelligence source told i. “I expect we will see a drastic rise in cyber attacks to critical services over the next 12 months.”

Another called the attack a “significant escalation” which challenges the definition of an “act of war”.

In a detailed security briefing with i, investigators from Prodaft – a privately funded cyber crime firm partnering with official organisations including Europol, the FBI, and NCA – warned that action against Qilin without looking at the wider hacking network would be “insignificant”.

Prodaft is part of Europol’s EC3 partner framework, which works with international law enforcement agencies as part of a coalition of specialist researchers, focused on unmasking some of the world’s most notorious cybercrime groups.

EC3 is an EU taskforce to help protect nations against cyber crime of all types, and continues to work with UK agencies after Brexit.",0,1719829715,,,0,lb3vcpz,t3_1dspo39,t1_lb3vbit,1719829731,2,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb

Pixie1001,,,"I mean, yes, that article from Japan sure does look convincing at first blush - until you realise he's only released a literature review in collaboration with another doctor who's completely lost the public trust after attempting to promote multiple bunk covid cures.

How could he possibly conclude the rising rate of 'turbo cancer' is connected to covid 19. Especially when the vaccine was administered world wide, and yet nobody else in the rest of the world is seeing a spike in the frequency or severely of cancer.

Maybe in his day he was very intelligent, and I'm sure he's done a lot of good research, but he's obviously started to lose it a bit if he's completely abandoning the scientific process taught to people in like 7 grade.

I found a whole reddit thread for the second link, going over all the crazy stuff that guy from the second tweet has done:

Here he is removing a bunch of data from studies done by actual scientists to pursue his agenda, because he didn't have anything compelling to add on his own.

https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/hiding-important-information-not-science

He had the full backing of DeSantis and the state of Florida to conduct an actual study to back his claims, but instead he just lied and editted the work of those actual scientists so they'd look like they supported his 'gut instinct' about the vaccine.

Again, I know this stuff can look very convincing, and I'm sure someone else you trusted shared all these links, cherry-picking picking people who seemed to be in position of authority within the field of medicine.

But there's a reason these people are being ridiculed by other scientists, and it's not just because they're speaking out against the consensus. It's because the science they're practicing is objectively bad.

If the covid vaccine safety trials were done the way these people seem to operate, drawing vague correlations from a small amount of data or dipping into pseudo science to look for a possible cure, the vaccine probably would be incredibly dangerous.

You should also ask yourself who, if not scientists trying to make the best and safest vaccine possible, might have an agenda to cover this stuff up.

Certainly not the US or UK governments, who were pretty open to anti-vaxx ideas at the time. So if the two most powerful countries in the western world didn't think vaccines were a big deal...

New  research(Link is external) (Link opens in new window) led by UCLA Health confirms that both Tai Chi and cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce insomnia in breast cancer survivors but also may provide additional health benefits by reducing inflammation and bolstering anti-viral defenses. 

Chronic insomnia is one of the most prominent symptoms experienced among cancer survivors and poses significant health concerns, including the risk of inflammatory disease that could increase the risk of cancer recurrence.  

About 30% of breast cancer survivors are reported to have insomnia, which is twice the rate of the general population. While previous research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy and mind-body interventions such as Tai Chi are effective at treating insomnia among breast cancer survivors, less is known about their effectiveness in reversing inflammation caused by insomnia. 

The new study, published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity this month, compared the two therapies among 90 breast cancer survivors using blood samples over 15 months to analyze changes in inflammation biomarkers. 

Researchers found Tai Chi specifically led to more significant, sustained reduction in inflammation among participants compared to cognitive behavioral therapy.

Sufficient_Bass2600,,,"ADDitudemag has absolutely no scientific credibility.
It is the magazine of a US based lobby group.


It has successfully forced the change in the US of the definition for ADHD to expand its criteria so that it now includes depression, impulsiveness and OCD. The initial reason was to change the scientific perception that ADHD was mostly a US based disease caused by cultural factors. All of those synptoms are unrelated to the initial problem of ADHD. However in Europe medical and clinical researchers are now pushing back on that redefinition.


ADHD was specifically coined as term to look at Attention Deficit disorder. People who could not concentrate. Pharmaceutical groups devised medical drug to assuage the fear of US parents. Because of the prevalence of boys over girls, a myth was created that women were underdiagnosed. In order to ""correct that imbalance"", other medical ailments were requalified as part of ADHD.

The reason why there is a now a pushback in Europe is because we now know that some of the treatments for ADHD are exactly the wrong kind of medication for those requalified ailments. **Different symptoms requiring different treatment point to different diseases**. Aggregating them all together just lead to further confusion. Giving medicines for ADHD to somebody who suffers from OCD will likely to result in a worse OCD. Same with people who are from bipolar.


There is a special place in hell for Lobby groups using their media competence to spread dis-information a la  _""Smoking does not cause cancer""_.

The point is not to minimise women issues but to avoid trying to tack women medical issues to an existing disease because there is talk about it and money spent on it. Itvdoes noy either groups the women and the ADHD sufferers.

Fasting appears to be effective based on peer-reviewed studies published in top journals (I am a scientist) - it is reported to increase the effectiveness of chemo and protects healthy body cells. Water fasting with some electrolytes is the best option. Some green tea, black tea are OK (no herbal teas as they may interfere with the chemo and no coffee as there is some research that shows caffeine interferes with some of the chemo drugs). If this is not possible, do not exceed 150-200 calories a day (this is better tolerated by most people who are new to fasting). Very watery soups helped me initially. You fast a minimum of 3 days, 2 days before chemo and one full day after receiving chemo. I did 4.5-5 days (3 days before chemo, and 2 days on the day and after) which is better than 3 days.

QHS_1111,,,"Cancer has changed everything about my life in both good and bad ways.

Upon diagnosis my friends, family and co workers rallied around me.  I had so much support and it really confirmed that I had aligned with the right people in my life.  On top of that I have made so many meaningful friendships within the cancer community, both online and at retreats. These are silver linings for me.  I now value my connections with others above everything.  

I lost trust in my body.  This one hurt.  I was active and prided myself on being strong and healthy.  When I was diagnosed with stage IV de novo at 38 years young with no other symptoms other than a lump, I was shocked.  How could this be true?  Why didn’t my  body warn me? why didn’t I have symptoms? I now have a hard time trusting my body.  I’ve had a DMX and remained flat, so on top of not trusting my body, I also didn’t love this new body.  So not only do I not trust this body, but it also makes me feel self conscious.  I’m working on both these things in therapy currently, and trying to remind myself that my breasts alone didn’t make me beautiful.

I lost my career.  The long term side effects of chemo and radiation have made it impossible to remain working in my role .  I suffer from very impactful cognitive issues, which made working so stressful.  I was falling behind, and becoming a burden on my peers, as I have many sick and personal days.  I was asked politely by my employer if I would consider Long term disability, and so I’ve chosen that route.  I am currently looking into starting over and attending university again.

I had a 12 year relationship end two years into my cancer journey.  The relationship didn’t dissolve directly because of my diagnosis, we had issues prior to that which were only amplified when you throw cancer in the mix.  Although this was very sad and emotionally tough at the time, I’ve come to realize it’s for the best and I’m actually happier now that I’m not in this relationship.  The sad reality though is finding love post DMX and with a stage IV diagnosis is proving to be almost impossible.

I’ve had so much change in 2.5 years I don’t even identify as the same person.  Cancer comes with a lot of hardship and pain, which really feels unfair.  That being said, in many ways I feel a lot happier.  I prioritize myself, I travel more, I’m meeting new people and falling in love a bit more with this version of me everyday.

Holiday_Shelter3635,,,"Thanks for all of the advice, this board never disappoints.

Here are answers to a couple of the questions that consistently came up in responses:

1.) I’m making $250K per year right now, and have averaged about $190K per year over my 25 year career when you factor in the early years where I was making about $150K.

2.) I grew up very poor, so I’ve had to shoulder the entire load myself, no inheritance, trust funds, etc.

3.) Though I’m in great health at 49, both of my parents died from cancer in their late 60’s. I’d like to think that I’ve lived a healthier life than them, but genetics is always in the back of my mind.

4.) I am a sole income earner for a household of 5 (my wife and I, two 18yo’s, one 14yo). It’s all been on my shoulders the whole way with no safety net.

5.) We just paid off our house, and have no other debt of any kind, and my property taxes ($3500) + home insurance ($870) + HOA ($1300) is roughly $500 per month.

6.) Regarding taking SS at 62 (like a fool as one responder said) versus waiting until max benefit at 70, it’s a bet on outliving your break even point. If I won’t really need that SS money then I can just save it as well and add it to the compounding wood pile for 8 years instead of sitting on zero and waiting for a higher rate at 70.
 
I was surprised that one response thought we’d have more savings than $1.6M at this stage. For a single income averaging ($190K per year to this point) to be mortgage free on a $1M house + $1.6M in savings supporting a family of 5 in AZ and FL (the two fairly HCOL areas we’ve spent the most time in) has been an exercise of great discipline and restraint.

Moving forward from here, my goal is to save $80K per year for the next 5+ years, let compounding do its thing for the money already saved (hopefully), and consider retiring at 55 makes sense.

Lastly, I’m very blessed and appreciative to have the job and income that I do, but a lot of stress and anxiety comes with my role, thus I don’t particularly want to do it longer than I have to. Plus, I’ve never really enjoyed myself along the way, I’ve just put my head down and worked hard my whole life…I want to start enjoying life a little more, and the things I enjoy most (my wife, hiking, biking, fishing) are all free.

If I can make it to 55 as a mostly empty nester (my 14yo will be 19 at that point), be mortgage free in a beautiful house that I love, have $2.5M saved at that point with an overall NW of roughly $3.7M, have SS supplementation just around the corner at 62, then what’s the point of working any more? So that I can deny myself even longer in the name of leaving more for the kids? They’ll each graduate college with a clean slate financially, and get $1M+ when my wife and I die (which is $1M+ more than I got) so I think my job will be well done at that point and I can finally sit down and exhale.

I just feel like I hear more people in my situation say that their money is going longer in retirement than they thought, and wish that they’d have retired earlier so that they could enjoy those early retirement years of 55-70 before their health gave way.

First, this documentary:

- Secrets of the Surface: The Mathematical Vision of Maryam Mirzakhani (2020)

An ideal, a pioneer, an Albert Einstein or Alan Turing of hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry in mathematics, with an unbelievably inspiring story. She serves as an inspiration to numerous female students all over the world, and many awards are presented in her honor. Prof. Maryam Mirzakhani, a young woman who was honored with the Fields Medal (even while battling cancer, she didn't give up), won 2 gold medals at the International Olympiad of Mathematics, achieving a full mark! Scientists often describe her work as wielding a magic wand. Sadly, she passed away a few years ago at a young age due to cancer.

May 12, the International Women in Mathematics Day, marks the birthday of the award-winning mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani.

This documentary tells the story of her life, the education system, politics, etc. It doesn't capture the whole culture, but it highlights one of the main parts, especially the lives of teenagers (interviewed with students).

Directed by George Paul Csicsery. Filmed in Canada, Iran, and the United States.


Other options first shot:

- Interstellar 

The black hole simulation is currently part of some astronomy courses in some universities.""


Second shots:

- The Theory of Everything
- The Imitation Game
 

Definitely magnificent visual effects and entertaining (IMAX 4K):

- The Martian (2015)


Philosophical sci-fi:

- Arrival (2016)
- GATTACA - Genetics is not everything. There are also epigenetic factors

They actively shadow ban anyone that won't comply as they are all in it together. 

Rockefeller started the American cancer society to do just that after his oil based ' medicine "" started giving people, you guessed it, CANCER. HE sponsored the medical community and flooded it with his henchmen to keep his profits flowing. Anyone that bucked the system was immediately labeled a quack and ostracized so voices were silenced. 


We are being played by the system, a system that pushes pills that treats but doesn't cure. They spend billions on advertising money that will be better spent on research. 

Want proof? How is it this an island like Cuba can develop a cure for lung cancer? It's not like they've got billions to spend on research but they've got people to care and not beholding the big pharma and the government. 
Now ask yourself, Why is this the first time, for many, that you've discovered this fact? Obviously big pharma do not want that getting informed because it makes them look like the corrupt individuals that they are.

vagueink,,,"Correct, the digestive tract isn’t 100% efficient so your previous statements about calories in/calories out are quite empty. You asked where the energy went. I told you, now you seem to be co-opting my point. Energy in doesn’t always mean energy out and carbohydrates are the effective energy mechanism…not protein in reasonable doses and not fiber in any dose. Point made hopefully.

Functional medicine definitely isn’t quackery and has cured more serious issues personally and within my rather large circle than conventional medicine. I’ve seen it put autoimmune disorders and cancer into remission and at present it’s the best hope for curing ALZ. The white wolf of conventional medicine. There’s a reason why the richest among us have abandoned conventional medicine when looking at life extension and innovation in the field of medicine and why very little of it is being done in heavily regulated western countries. My basic guess is that conventional medicine and by extension conventional research has been co-opted by capitalism and then kneecapped by regulation. Share holders, political lobbyists and university endowments influencing medicine is a horrible blend of idiocy. It’s great you’ve picked a noble field but my guess is you won’t innovate much until you wake up from conventional thought. I hope you prove me wrong but it’s more likely you just keep pushing the rock up the hill looking for the magic pill that cures a lack of mindfulness in the masses. 

If you are unwilling to receive my anecdotal lead (your words) I’ve presented you and instead use a fairly shallow Wikipedia post to attempt to make your point, then I believe my original reply holds true. You should experience for yourself rather than just read. It’s not hard to fast. You’re a researcher, research for real. Also, as a researcher you should be ashamed for using Wikipedia as a source. Give Dr Dale Bredesen a read if you want a nice introduction into what functional medicine actually means.

Detoxing isn’t a myth, that’s absurd, it’s simply a term used to encompass a process used to encourage the elimination of unwanted things in the body. I’ve experienced it first hand as have many of my circle and millions around the world. Ours  definitions might differ but a simple example (by my definition) would be the use autophagy to eat cancer cells and dispel toxic waste. Conventional medicine uses radiation and now designs vaccines to cure cancer while the mechanism to clean the body of unwanted cellular growth is as simple as letting itself, eat itself. Why wouldn’t this be shared with NPCs? Because there’s not much money in telling people who suffer from chronic issues to just stop eating carbohydrates. Full circle.

I really hope you never have to experience the major limitations of conventional medicine/research yourself but if you do I hope you remember this post and mix it up a bit. It might save your life or the life of someone you really love in such a simple way.

You know that being a scientist and drug user aren’t mutually exclusive, right? Sometimes a legitimate researcher takes an interest in the effects of the chemicals and compounds they study. Without this gray area of experimentation where would psychology be today? 

Those “biologics for cancer” you mentioned, they need to be tested as well, eventually on humans. Are those humans scum as well because they’re ingesting something without big pharma branding yet?

So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father’s situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister’s college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn’t have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn’t happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn’t respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she’s “poor” and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop “holding her tuition over her head”. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever “pay me back” nor have I ever “held it over her head”. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn’t realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she’s still young. She once again didn’t reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo. It’s a large sum of money and I know for a fact that she did not have that money saved up and it would be too early for her to get her first paycheck so now I am worried about where/what she may have done to get that much money. She still isn’t replying to my texts and I’m just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn’t from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her. Also, I will not stop paying her tuition even if we are not talking because I will always love her and want her to have a future in the field she wants to.

Feminists have used me for sex while feigning friendship, promised me honesty and help with my high-functioning autism while lying and manipulating me, spread untrue rumors alleging I'm schizophrenic after I trusted them with knowledge of my disability (definitely not, no symptoms, currently receiving mental health care and my provider has confirmed my reasoning and perceptions are sound), denied me the opportunity to speak in my own defense, gaslit me, offered help and withdrawn it, body shamed me about a million different times, emotionally abused me, told me I was dangerous for reporting attempts of others to hurt me, lied about my behavior in the pursuit of petty grudges, encouraged dangerous women to girlboss by destroying other people, punished me for reporting literal crimes, and discouraged friends from listening when I was suffering and desperately needed someone to talk to.


Feminist books are great. The PR is wonderful. Feminist people treat men like shit. The best of you are apathetic. The worst of you are vampires for whom the ability to hurt men is a perk. There is zero policing against abusive women who use the movement as a source of justifications for hurting others, you simply deny it ever happens instead.


Women who are dangerous people target those who are vulnerable who others will not believe or care about if they report wrongdoing. Actual feminism encourages women not to believe or care about men who report wrongdoing. If you want to help people, just help them, no need for the ideological baggage and the tug of war to attach positive sentiment to the ism.",0,1719813320,,,0,lb37xth,t3_1dsemho,t1_lb2wbly,1719813334,1,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844

Nothing wrong with me I was a happy and nice kid, just antisocial and always feared trouble or mean girls/confrontation, although growing up with sisters it was the norm. Now it’s in general life, learning what superficial people are, learning that I’ve been manipulated, me not being able to trust people, people only wanting my body or like having me around because of my appearance. Coping with it. Always being talked over and cut short of my goals, and my dreams were crushed early on because my boss in my big girl job can’t stop commenting about my chest or ass or anything sexual at all so I don’t enjoy it anymore. It being hard to change work environments and fit into new work environments. My exboss died suddenly at 29 (he was an amazing person. Treated me like a baby sister), that same place I worked at burned down a few months later, in those months I did my best to comfort his girlfriend and didn’t really leave her side she was not mentally good, I fell into the wrong crowd, got SA’d and sick, I did people and things I was not proud of because I was just lost. My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, my sisters moved 2-7 hours away from home. I learned my exclusive relationship that lasted three years was just a ploy for attention and that he used every trick in the book to manipulate me and groom me, I’m heartbroken, I’m all alone and I have a boyfriend now which I love but he cannot handle any of this. He is a baby and not in any good way. And I seriously would move away but I’m the only daughter left. I’d go and talk to my best friend about this but she’s dating my groomers brother and I hate looking at him. And he almost never leaves her side. I’m depressed beyond imagining.

MeanMugginMin,,,"TL;DR- My recovery has been pretty smooth, honestly. I had a rough go before, maybe that's why it seems easy-ish.  

Had a radical open procedure with vertical cut. I was bleeding to death. 3 ER trips. I had a D&C, unfortunately, that made my body decide to clot up (but not stop bleeding of course!) I developed a saddle PE and 2 DVTs in my leg. My local hospital decided to take the PE out, as it was going to kill me if they did not. They also did a uterine artery embolization while I was under to staunch the bleeding hopefully and gave me 5 units of blood. They didn't have gyn/onc available, so they were trying to transfer me to mine, an hour away. That hospital rejected me. My gyn/onc was down in LA for the holidays (Thanksgiving) and unavailable. They tried UCSF. They said no, because my D&C was clear of cancer. Last minute at 1am, Stanford had a free bed. So my hospital put me in an ambulance at 1am for a 4 to 5 hour drive. Super! It was late November, I was in only a gown, and the ambulance heater was broken. (I am THAT lucky!) I did get there alive however! Stanford tried to stabilize me, topped up my tank with another unit of blood, and set to figuring out wtf was wrong with me. They tested the shit out of me for 5 days. I was beginning to wonder if I was just a guinea pig. It sucked because I was utterly alone. Far from home and no friends or family near. On day 4.5 it was grim, because I wasn't getting stable enough for the hysto I needed. Another unit of blood given.  At 6am on day 5, I sneezed. Something popped and I started gushing blood. I called the nurse. She looked and was shook. She grabbed her phone and started taking pictures of my crotch to send to the doctors. By 9am I was being wheeled to the OR, and told that I may not make it, it was very risky, but I had no other choice. Cue me uncontrollable sobbing. My little sister saved the day and drove my mom the 5 hour trip up to be there just before my surgery. Only one day though.

I woke up! I don't remember much! I had cancer confirmed. I spent 5 days in-patient after surgery and then took a transport ambulance home.....super not fun to ride that long with a giant open belly wound!  I slept in a recliner (still do) I'm almost 7 months post op.  I don't get around that great, but I should mention that before all this crap, I survived a stroke(Yeah, my body is out to get me!) It left me paralyzed on my left side. I was/am still learning to walk again. My bitch uterus set me back real far! I can walk, but not well or far. I move like I'm really drunk all the time. 

 After all that shit, yeah recovery was ok. I had pain...omg did I. But it was from the thrombectomy procedure a few days before the hysto. It was in my leg! My belly hurt if I sneezed or laughed or whatnot, but it was tolerable. I feel like I'm either part cat with 9 lives, or I'm just real dense and don't know when to quit, lol.",0,1719815441,,,0,lb3b7ob,t3_1ds6jfs,t3_1ds6jfs,1719815458,2,False,hysterectomy,t5_2x8iq
wrosecrans,,,"> So then the real question since this is about science and methodology, you seem comfortable saying (I would imagine) a chemist, say, can make a model about this chemical or another will react if put in this condition or another.

Non replication of results with small numbers happens all the time in every field of science.  A chemist has the advantage that there are zillions of molecules in a sample, and it's easy to cook up a thousand small test samples of a material.  But in medicine for example, there are constantly weird statistical anomalies where they do a small study on a few people and get a result that chocolate cures cancer, or ice cream causes herpes.  Then other groups try to replicate the result with another study with more people and it's bunk.  The original study turns out to have been a statistical fluke where it was just chance that some people who ate chocolate also happened to beat cancer.  I listen to a podcast called ""This Week In Virology"" and every week they talk about some interesting new preliminary study, and there is usually a couple of minutes of discussion about the sample size and the plausibility and whether they think the study actually found any real result, etc.  Because replication with a large sample size and isolation of variables takes time and is super important.  Real scientists constantly talk about ""n was only 75"" and ""what's the confidence interval?"" and what statistical tests are used to indicate statistical significance of a result and whether they are adequate.

Predicting the last ten US presidential elections is a very small sample size.  You can't run separate test elections to isolate the significance of the variables in the prediction method.  You can't run 1,000 extra elections.  There's no way to do the normal science of replication work and establishing statistical significance, so yeah it pretty much has to be treated as guessing from a scientific perspective because random chance is sufficient to predict the result so nothing more is needed to explain the available data.  That doesn't indicate the system is wrong.  Just that there can't be enough data to conclude it's good.

Social science as a whole can do a lot of rigorous science.  You can do tests with thousands of people and get results about various topics.  But predicting presidential elections just isn't testable in the same way.",0,1719816959,,,0,lb3dgph,t3_1dsa19u,t1_lb319lz,1719816977,3,False,politics,t5_2cneq

The woman who is pregnant or a mother also gets exposed to gens like cancer, HIV and infertility, while her unborn baby can be infected and come out SEVERELY disabled in many ways. As well as be seriously damaged by the emotional toll stress puts on the fetus.

On top of these consequences, one's entire life entangles with their spouse practically day-to-day, and they are usually ousted socially and financially to the most devastating absolutely degree, some ending up in poverty, shame and losing their children.

Lastly it's the deepest form of emotional betrayal, as well as humiliation and rejected on the most fundamental level. Rejection of one as a life partner (man for his work, provision, protection, woman for her dedication, sacrifice of body and life) and as a human being there to support you in literally everything. Most people NEVER recover from this level of betrayal. 

Stealing, gambling, or betraying a business partner is less bad, because that person isn't the one who dedicates their life to building something good with you, and lays in bed every night with their eyes closed in a greatest show of human vulnerability. If you can betray someone who trusts you this much, you're less than any criminal scum save for pedophiles and killers IMO.

How do you get through it? By holding that head high. And by high, I mean in the clouds my man. I can't tell you how proud I am of the time you've been sober.

As it turns out, other doctors confirmed she didn’t have a tumor. My step grandfather was told he was fine and probably strained too much at work and that was why he was peeing blood. When it happened again two years later, other doctors confirmed he had stage 4 prostate cancer that had spread. He died from it. My aunt was born with cancer and a whole series of doctors told my grandparents she seemed fine and they couldn’t figure out why she was in pain. Finally a doctor realized she had cancer. She fought for a couple of years before she died at the age of 3. They aren’t always right.

I don’t doubt humans have some amount of impact on the environment, but why is the impact of natural geologic processes never addressed or considered when discussing the matter? Long before humans, there were periods where the Earth was covered with ice, periods where it was completely unfrozen, and periods where it was basically a fireball. We technically live in an Ice Age even now since we have polar ice caps. How much of the issue is just Earth doing what Earth always does? There was always going to be a time when all the ice melted and the temperatures got hotter and the earth entered a greenhouse period. So how much of our current situation is due to the inevitability of Earth’s natural processes? Scientists say it is virtually impossible for the Earth to turn into a Venus-like runaway greenhouse regardless of human activity, so what real impact can we make by completely upheaving society as we know it?

Street_Hedgehog_9595,RomanCatholic,Roman Catholic,"Lemme ask you this. If someone came along and said I'd give you 1,000,000 dollars to avoid this sin, what would you do differently? Or, if someone was holding your family hostage and said to you I would kill them if you fall one more time, is there anything better you can do? Now apply that to your life. The tools to win in this situation are available to you, but you need to actually use them, and be determined to use them. It is absolutely necessary to take this seriously. You DO have the tools available to avoid this sin. 

Here are at least key things I think of.  

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠You need complete full determination. One must do a great deal of effort (big extremes is what I'm getting at) to himself to stop sin. It is like a cancer. You do not treat a cancer with a nap and cough syrup. With deadly diseases, powerful remedies are necessary.  Do your maximum in every way, and treat it like the most important thing, embracing great sacrifice. Hence, you must hate the sin truly, fully, and fully entirely.



2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Make a new prayer life. Give thanks to God always, and turn always. Give Him thanks in the morning, and praise Him in the day. Speak and seek Him constantly. Without constant prayer, I cannot imagine any great chance of success. From St. Alphonsus: ""St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves.... but with the princes of hell.... By these words he wishes to admonish us that we have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall conquer all enemies. “I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me.” (Phil. iv. 13.) But this assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find.” (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost.
