    "text": "Project Authors: Tiana Le, Sheeba Moghal, Ishaan Babbar, Liz Kovalchuk\nIn the digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, understanding how people navigate and trust health information is critical. With countless sources such as healthcare professionals, government agencies, social media, and online forums, it is essential to explore what the United States population believes about the reliability and accessibility of health information. To better understand this phenomenon, data was gathered from an online forum called Reddit. The Reddit dataset comprises textual data that offers valuable insights into the information shared online about health, particularly topics related to cancer. Using NLP methods, we can explore the most common topics and also the sentiment toward these topics. In addition to the textual data, we will also use the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which is administered by National Cancer Institute. In this survey, people were asked directly about what they think about health information. Using both the Reddit data and HINTS, we seek to understand trust, frustrations, and overall sentiment about healthcare and more specifically, cancer information.\nOur project explores the Pushshift Reddit Dataset to examine trust in healthcare, likely narrowing specifically to r/cancer forums. While there are some assumptions that need to be made to pair our corroborating dataset, the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) survey, with the Reddit dataset, we believe that we compare and use both of these datasets to investigate the following questions:\n\nIs public sentiment toward healthcare and cancer generally positive, or negative, in an online social platform?\nIs there evidence of trust (or lack thereof) when the public discusses healthcare?\nEvidence of other interpersonal conflict in healthcare discussions and emotion / sentiment analysis (e.g. sadness, disgust, surprise, joy, anger)."

    "text": "The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS)\nThe Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is a significant research initiative launched by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2001. It aims to assess how adults in the United States access and utilize health information with a particular focus on cancer-related topics. HINTS provides a rich source of data that helps researchers understand public interactions with health information, including trends in health communication, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding cancer prevention and control.\nIt is an excellent starting place for structured questionnaires that would be helfpul to enhance in a “more accessible” format of Reddit data.\nHINTS employs a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey methodology targeting non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older. This design allows for the collection of data that reflects the diverse experiences and perspectives of the U.S. population13. Annual Administration: Initially conducted biennially, HINTS has transitioned to an annual survey format. This change enhances the ability to track evolving trends in health information access and utilization over time.\nThe survey seeks information on:\n\nHealth information-seeking behaviors\nCancer prevention and screening practices\nKnowledge and perceptions related to cancer risks\nAccess to healthcare services\nUtilization of technology for health information37.\nPublicly Available Data: HINTS data is freely accessible through its website, allowing researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals to utilize this information for various applications, including the design and evaluation of health communication programs9.\n\nThough HINTS was initially conducted biennially, HINTS has transitioned to an annual survey format. This change enhances the ability to track evolving trends in health information access and utilization over time."

    "text": "Takeaways from Random Forest Models\nInitial Random Forest (RF) Model\nThe Initial Random Forest model achieves a high accuracy of 73.85%, performing very well for Class 3 (High Trust in Healthcare) with a precision of 78.33% and an excellent recall of 92.16%. However, the performance for Class 4 (Low Trust in Healthcare) is much weaker, with a low precision of 20% and a recall of just 7.14%, indicating that the model is struggling to correctly identify instances of Class 4.\nBalanced Random Forest (SMOTE) Model\nThe Balanced Random Forest model (with SMOTE) has a lower accuracy of 52.31%. While it improves the recall for Class 4 to 28.57%, the precision remains low at 16%. Class 3 performs well with a precision of 75% and a recall of 58.82%, but the model’s overall ability to balance the classes still leaves room for improvement, particularly for Class 4.\nTuned Random Forest Model\nThe Tuned Random Forest model shows improved performance with accuracy increasing to 61.54%. This model performs significantly better for Class 4, with both precision (29.63%) and recall (57.14%) improving. The precision for Class 3 is also very high (84.21%), with a solid recall of 62.75%. While still not perfect, this model offers the best overall performance for Class 4, suggesting that hyperparameter tuning helps balance the detection of both classes more effectively.\nConclusions:\n\nTuned RF is likely the best model based on this comparison, as it performs well across all metrics.\n\nTuned RF has the highest recall for Class 4 (0.85)\nTuned RF has the highest recall for Class 3 (0.70)\nTuned RF also has the highest precision for Class 4 (0.75)\nTuned RF has the highest precision for Class 3 (0.85)\nThe Tuned RF model has the highest accuracy (0.80)"

Given this information, we will also look at the Reddit dataset to see the level of trust users have when they mention the government in their comments versus doctors. In addition, the people who felt frustrated about the information they received about cancer is approximately 1.105. In the Reddit dataset, we also look for an equivalent using textual data by looking at positive/negative and emotion sentiment analysis on comments that include the word “cancer”.\n\n\nCode\nprint(summary(hints_select_coded))\n\n\n     HHID             updatedate        SeekCancerInfo   CancerFrustrated\n Length:6252        Min.   :1.387e+10   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.000   \n Class :character   1st Qu.:1.387e+10   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.000   \n Mode  :character   Median :1.387e+10   Median :0.0000   Median :1.000   \n                    Mean   :1.387e+10   Mean   :0.4654   Mean   :1.105   \n                    3rd Qu.:1.387e+10   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:2.000   \n                    Max.   :1.389e+10   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :3.000   \n                                        NA's   :17       NA's   :3420    \n CancerTrustDoctor CancerTrustFamily CancerTrustGov CancerTrustCharities\n Min.   :0.000     Min.   :1.000     Min.   :0.00   Min.   :0.000       \n 1st Qu.:2.000     1st Qu.:1.000     1st Qu.:1.00   1st Qu.:1.000       \n Median :3.000     Median :2.000     Median :2.00   Median :1.000       \n Mean   :2.656     Mean   :1.678     Mean   :1.92   Mean   :1.403       \n 3rd Qu.:3.000     3rd Qu.:2.000     3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:2.000       \n Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.00   Max.   :3.000       \n NA's   :94        NA's   :783       NA's   :273    NA's   :308         \n CancerTrustReligiousOrgs CancerTrustScientists Electronic2_HealthInfo\n Min.   :0.0000           Min.   :0.000         Min.   :0.0000        \n 1st Qu.:0.0000           1st Qu.:2.000         1st Qu.:1.0000        \n Median :1.0000           Median :3.000         Median :1.0000        \n Mean   :0.9484           Mean   :2.357         Mean   :0.8534        \n 3rd Qu.:2.0000           3rd Qu.:3.000         3rd Qu.:1.0000        \n Max.   :3.0000           Max.   :3.000         Max.   :1.0000        \n NA's   :280              NA's   :218           NA's   :1130          \n MisleadingHealthInfo TrustHCSystem\n Min.   :0.000        Min.   :0.0  \n 1st Qu.:1.000        1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :2.000        Median :2.0  \n Mean   :1.716        Mean   :2.2  \n 3rd Qu.:3.000        3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :3.000        Max.   :3.0  \n NA's   :82           NA's   :134  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nhints_select_coded_clean &lt;- drop_na(hints_select_coded)\n\ntable1 &lt;- hints_select_coded_clean %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary(\n    statistic = all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ± {sd}\",  \n  )\n\ntable1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 2,3151\n\n\n\n\nSeekCancerInfo\n\n\n\n\n    1\n2,315 (100%)\n\n\nCancerFrustrated\n\n\n\n\n    0\n759 (33%)\n\n\n    1\n780 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n624 (27%)\n\n\n    3\n152 (6.6%)\n\n\nCancerTrustDoctor\n\n\n\n\n    0\n11 (0.5%)\n\n\n    1\n72 (3.1%)\n\n\n    2\n441 (19%)\n\n\n    3\n1,791 (77%)\n\n\nCancerTrustFamily\n\n\n\n\n    1\n970 (42%)\n\n\n    2\n1,225 (53%)\n\n\n    3\n120 (5.2%)\n\n\nCancerTrustGov\n\n\n\n\n    0\n133 (5.7%)\n\n\n    1\n357 (15%)\n\n\n    2\n1,065 (46%)\n\n\n    3\n760 (33%)\n\n\nCancerTrustCharities\n\n\n\n\n    0\n251 (11%)\n\n\n    1\n798 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n1,086 (47%)\n\n\n    3\n180 (7.8%)\n\n\nCancerTrustReligiousOrgs\n\n\n\n\n    0\n907 (39%)\n\n\n    1\n832 (36%)\n\n\n    2\n494 (21%)\n\n\n    3\n82 (3.5%)\n\n\nCancerTrustScientists\n\n\n\n\n    0\n41 (1.8%)\n\n\n    1\n165 (7.1%)\n\n\n    2\n608 (26%)\n\n\n    3\n1,501 (65%)\n\n\nElectronic2_HealthInfo\n2,203 (95%)\n\n\nMisleadingHealthInfo\n\n\n\n\n    0\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    1\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    2\n959 (41%)\n\n\n    3\n782 (34%)\n\n\nTrustHCSystem\n\n\n\n\n    0\n60 (2.6%)\n\n\n    1\n231 (10.0%)\n\n\n    2\n1,109 (48%)\n\n\n    3\n915 (40%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot provides a visualization of the median, mode, and outliers in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot_data &lt;- hints_select_coded %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate)\n\n\nboxplot_data_long &lt;- boxplot_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\nggplot(boxplot_data_long, aes(x = Variable, y = Value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = \"red\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"HINTS Boxplot\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Values\"\n  ) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 4)) \n\n\nWarning: Removed 6739 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between different survey questions.\nUsing a correlation plot, the relationships are evaluated between the different survey questions.

    "text": "What is the sentiment distribution across these diverse healthcare subreddits?\nPurpose: To understand how different healthcare communities perceive their situations, we analyzed the sentiment distribution across various healthcare-related subreddits by categorizing each comment as positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment score. Positive scores indicate optimistic or supportive comments, negative scores reflect frustration or concern, and neutral scores suggest factual or balanced tones. This analysis provides a snapshot of the emotional climate across healthcare subreddits, helping us gauge the general sentiment expressed by members of each community.\nOutcome: It is seen that there is right skewed distribution for ‘negative’ and positive has a left-skewed distribution with an expection for ‘WomensHealth’ subreddit.

    "text": "Which emotions are most common in specific healthcare communities?\nThe goal of this analysis is to identify the most common emotions, such as sadness, anger, and trust, within different healthcare communities on Reddit. By examining the emotional tone of discussions in each subreddit, we can gain insights into the unique challenges and concerns faced by members of these communities. Understanding predominant emotions in specific subreddits helps reveal the emotional landscape of each group, highlighting areas of support, frustration, or other significant feelings that characterize their experiences.\nNote: Used three approaches here 1. TextBlob 2. Vader 3. Transformers\nOutcome: As we have usd three approaches to judge polarity, sentiment, and emotion, it’ll be broken down accordingly\n\nOn basis of Polarity: The analysis reveals varying predominant emotions across healthcare subreddits, with each community displaying unique emotional tones. Subreddits like braincancer and skincancer show notably high positive sentiment, possibly reflecting resilience or hope within these groups, while Fuckcancer and Hashimotos indicate stronger expressions of frustration or anger. Communities like CancerCaregivers and HealthInsurance have a more balanced emotional tone, with a mix of support and concerns.\nThe sentiment analysis across healthcare subreddits shows a wide range of emotional tones. Subreddits like braincancer, predental, and HealthInsurance exhibit higher positive sentiment, possibly reflecting optimism or supportive environments. In contrast, subreddits such as UlcerativeColitis, Lymphedema, and leukemia lean more negative, indicating challenging or difficult discussions. Many subreddits, including breastcancer and cancer, have a high proportion of neutral sentiment, suggesting factual or balanced discussions.\nThe analysis of emotions across healthcare subreddits reveals a diverse emotional landscape, with certain emotions being more prominent in specific communities. For example, sadness is particularly high in subreddits such as Cancersurvivors, BRCA, and predental, likely reflecting the emotional challenges related to these conditions. Fear is notably prevalent in subreddits like skincancer, thyroidcancer, and publichealth, indicating concerns over diagnosis, treatment, and potential health risks. On the other hand, joy is relatively high in WomensHealth and braincancer, suggesting instances of shared positive experiences or supportive interactions.

By examining this association, we can gain insights into how the depth of engagement in comments correlates with emotional expression across healthcare communities. This analysis may reveal whether individuals expressing strong sentiments tend to elaborate more on their experiences compared to those with neutral or less intense sentiments.\nOutcome:\n\n\nThe average comment length varies widely across healthcare subreddits, reflecting different levels of engagement. Subreddits like HealthInsurance, UlcerativeColitis, and predental have longer comments, suggesting more detailed discussions. In contrast, communities like skincancer, pancreaticcancer, and Health have shorter comments, likely indicating brief or factual exchanges. These variations highlight differences in the depth of interaction within each community.\n\n\nIn terms of the association between commenth length and sentiment score, though it is a visual scatterplot, there is not much association betweent the both.

Here, we analyze engagement using metrics like ‘controversiality’ and ‘mentions’ to uncover patterns in community response.\nOutcomes: - Using Controversiality: The data reveals that most subreddits exhibit low to zero levels of “controversiality,” indicating minimal engagement or conflict in community interactions for most topics. However, a few subreddits, such as lymphoma and nursing, show slightly higher values, suggesting that discussions in these communities may spark more diverse opinions or higher engagement. - Using “Conflict” and “Support Mentions”: This shows significant variation in community dynamics. Subreddits like Autoimmune, CrohnsDisease, Fuckcancer, HealthInsurance, and braincancer have high percentages for both conflict and support mentions, suggesting these communities frequently discuss both interpersonal challenges and offer mutual support. On the other hand, subreddits like Cancersurvivors and CancerCaregivers reflect a high level of support mentions but little conflict, possibly indicating these communities focus more on encouragement and less on contentious discussions. Subreddits such as thyroidcancer and testicularcancer have moderate levels of both conflict and support, showing a balanced mix of challenges and supportive exchanges.

    "text": "Is there a difference in sentiment or emotion between users who post frequently versus those who post infrequently?\nPurpose: To explore whether frequent posters differ in sentiment or emotional expression compared to infrequent posters, potentially indicating deeper engagement or ongoing health concerns. Since unique user IDs aren’t available, comment length will be used as a proxy for engagement, with longer comments representing more involved or frequent contributors.\nOutcome: The sentiment scores suggest that frequent posters have a generally neutral sentiment with a slight positive inclination (-0.011), whereas infrequent posters lean more negative with a sentiment score of -0.407. This indicates that users who post more often may express more balanced or slightly positive emotions, while those who post infrequently tend to express more negativity in their comments. This could reflect a higher level of involvement or support within the community for frequent posters, while infrequent posters may only engage during times of distress or negative experiences.\n\n\nCode\n# comment length in terms of word count\ndf['comment_length'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\n\n# comment length threshold (e.g., more than 50 words as 'detailed' but can edit this\ndf['engagement_type'] = df['comment_length'].apply(lambda x: 'Frequent' if x &gt; 50 else 'Infrequent')\n\n# average sentiment score by engagement type\navg_sentiment_engagement = df.groupby('engagement_type')['sentiment_score'].mean()\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\navg_sentiment_engagement.plot(kind='bar', color=['skyblue', 'salmon'])\nplt.title('Average Sentiment Score by Engagement Type (Proxy)')\nplt.xlabel('Engagement Type (Proxy)')\nplt.ylabel('Average Sentiment Score')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.show()\n\n\nStatementMeta(ba5e360d-f184-47a0-9859-76b5031b79e3, 61, 34, Finished, Available, Finished)"

    "text": "Do specific healthcare-related terms or topics (e.g., “treatment,” “diagnosis,” “insurance”) correlate with particular emotions?\nPurpose: To explore whether specific healthcare-related terms or topics, like “treatment,” “diagnosis,” or “insurance,” are associated with distinct emotions. For example, discussions around insurance may evoke frustration, while conversations about successful treatments could elicit feelings of relief. Understanding these correlations can provide insight into the emotional landscape surrounding different aspects of healthcare within the community.\nOutcome: The sentiment scores across various healthcare subreddits show notable variation. Subreddits like CancerCaregivers and WomensHealth display high positive sentiment, potentially reflecting supportive environments or success stories within these communities. Conversely, subreddits such as UlcerativeColitis and Cancersurvivors show significantly negative sentiment scores, possibly indicating the challenges or frustrations often shared in these groups. Topics like HealthInsurance and thyroidcancer have more moderate positive sentiments, while pancreaticcancer and publichealth lean negative, suggesting complex or distressing issues discussed in these areas.

    "text": "What are the most common expressions of gratitude, frustration, or hope?\nPurpose: Identifying the most common expressions of gratitude, frustration, and hope offers valuable insight into the language used for support, shared challenges, and encouragement within healthcare communities. This analysis helps uncover how individuals convey their emotions, revealing the words and phrases that resonate most when expressing appreciation, challenges, or optimism.\nNote: The words are editable\nOutcome: The data reveals that “hope” is the most frequently expressed emotion among the three categories, with 62 mentions. This suggests that individuals within these healthcare communities often express optimism or a desire for positive outcomes. Expressions of gratitude, with 22 mentions, indicate an appreciation for support or shared experiences, reflecting a sense of community and thankfulness. In contrast, “frustration” is mentioned less frequently, with 6 mentions, signaling that while there are challenges, they may be less dominant in the discourse compared to hopeful or thankful sentiments. This analysis, using keywords like “thank you,” “frustrated,” and “hope,” helps highlight the tone of discussions within these communities.\n\n\nCode\n# keywords for each emotion category\n\n# can edit these words to anything else\ngratitude_keywords = [\"thank you\", \"thanks\", \"appreciate\"]\nhope_keywords = [\"hope\", \"optimistic\", \"wish\"]\nfrustration_keywords = [\"frustrated\", \"annoyed\", \"disappointed\"]\n\ndf['gratitude'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: any(word in x.lower() for word in gratitude_keywords))\ndf['frustration'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: any(word in x.lower() for word in frustration_keywords))\ndf['hope'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: any(word in x.lower() for word in hope_keywords))\nemotion_counts = df[['gratitude', 'hope', 'frustration']].sum()\n\n# Add theming \nhex_colors = [\"#3d6469\", \"#ffa205\", \"#5f0922\"] \n\nemotion_counts.plot(kind='bar', color= hex_colors)\nplt.title('Frequency of Expressions of Gratitude, Frustration, and Hope')\nplt.xlabel('Emotion Category')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\nStatementMeta(ba5e360d-f184-47a0-9859-76b5031b79e3, 64, 46, Finished, Available, Finished)"

    "text": "How do emotional responses change when users discuss their own health experiences versus others’ experiences?\nPurpose To understand if users show distinct emotional responses when sharing their own health experiences versus supporting others, providing insight into how personal versus supportive perspectives influence the type and intensity of emotions expressed. This can help identify patterns of empathy, vulnerability, or encouragement within the community.\nOutcome: The sentiment analysis shows varying emotional responses based on whether users are discussing their own health experiences or others’ experiences. When discussing their own health challenges alone, users express more negative sentiment (average sentiment score of -0.398). In contrast, users who mention both personal and others’ experiences exhibit a slight positive sentiment (0.072). Users focusing solely on others’ experiences show a less negative sentiment (-0.095) compared to personal discussions. This suggests that users may exhibit more vulnerability or frustration when discussing personal challenges, while discussions about others’ experiences might invoke more neutral or positive support-oriented responses.\n\n\nCode\n# using \"my\" and \"your\" personal and other-focused comments\ndf['personal_experience'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: \"i \" in x.lower() or \"my \" in x.lower())\ndf['other_experience'] = df['body'].apply(lambda x: \"you \" in x.lower() or \"your \" in x.lower())\n\n# avg sentiment for personal vs. other experiences\navg_sentiment_experience = df.groupby(['personal_experience', 'other_experience'])['sentiment_score'].mean()\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\navg_sentiment_experience.plot(kind='bar', color=['lightcoral', 'lightblue'])\nplt.title('Average Sentiment Score for Personal vs. Other Experiences')\nplt.xlabel('Experience Type')\nplt.ylabel('Average Sentiment Score')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.show()\n\n\nStatementMeta(ba5e360d-f184-47a0-9859-76b5031b79e3, 61, 33, Finished, Available, Finished)"
