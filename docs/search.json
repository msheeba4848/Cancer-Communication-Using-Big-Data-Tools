    "text": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nlibrary(gt)\ngt(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n18.1\n6\n225.0\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n14.3\n8\n360.0\n245\n3.21\n3.570\n15.84\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n19.2\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.30\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n17.8\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.90\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n16.4\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n4.070\n17.40\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n17.3\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.730\n17.60\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n15.2\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.780\n18.00\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n10.4\n8\n472.0\n205\n2.93\n5.250\n17.98\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n10.4\n8\n460.0\n215\n3.00\n5.424\n17.82\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n14.7\n8\n440.0\n230\n3.23\n5.345\n17.42\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n15.5\n8\n318.0\n150\n2.76\n3.520\n16.87\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n15.2\n8\n304.0\n150\n3.15\n3.435\n17.30\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n13.3\n8\n350.0\n245\n3.73\n3.840\n15.41\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n19.2\n8\n400.0\n175\n3.08\n3.845\n17.05\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n27.3\n4\n79.0\n66\n4.08\n1.935\n18.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n26.0\n4\n120.3\n91\n4.43\n2.140\n16.70\n0\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n\n\n19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n\n\n21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2"

below, the mean for trusting a doctor is higher than trusting the government. Given this information, we will also look at the Reddit dataset to see the level of trust users have when they mention the government in their comments versus doctors. In addition, the people who felt frustrated about the information they received about cancer is approximately 1.105. In the Reddit dataset, we also look for an equivalent using textual data by looking at positive/negative and emotion sentiment analysis on comments that include the word “cancer”.\n\n\nCode\nprint(summary(hints_select_coded))\n\n\n     HHID             updatedate        SeekCancerInfo   CancerFrustrated\n Length:6252        Min.   :1.387e+10   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.000   \n Class :character   1st Qu.:1.387e+10   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.000   \n Mode  :character   Median :1.387e+10   Median :0.0000   Median :1.000   \n                    Mean   :1.387e+10   Mean   :0.4654   Mean   :1.105   \n                    3rd Qu.:1.387e+10   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:2.000   \n                    Max.   :1.389e+10   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :3.000   \n                                        NA's   :17       NA's   :3420    \n CancerTrustDoctor CancerTrustFamily CancerTrustGov CancerTrustCharities\n Min.   :0.000     Min.   :1.000     Min.   :0.00   Min.   :0.000       \n 1st Qu.:2.000     1st Qu.:1.000     1st Qu.:1.00   1st Qu.:1.000       \n Median :3.000     Median :2.000     Median :2.00   Median :1.000       \n Mean   :2.656     Mean   :1.678     Mean   :1.92   Mean   :1.403       \n 3rd Qu.:3.000     3rd Qu.:2.000     3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:2.000       \n Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.00   Max.   :3.000       \n NA's   :94        NA's   :783       NA's   :273    NA's   :308         \n CancerTrustReligiousOrgs CancerTrustScientists Electronic2_HealthInfo\n Min.   :0.0000           Min.   :0.000         Min.   :0.0000        \n 1st Qu.:0.0000           1st Qu.:2.000         1st Qu.:1.0000        \n Median :1.0000           Median :3.000         Median :1.0000        \n Mean   :0.9484           Mean   :2.357         Mean   :0.8534        \n 3rd Qu.:2.0000           3rd Qu.:3.000         3rd Qu.:1.0000        \n Max.   :3.0000           Max.   :3.000         Max.   :1.0000        \n NA's   :280              NA's   :218           NA's   :1130          \n MisleadingHealthInfo TrustHCSystem\n Min.   :0.000        Min.   :0.0  \n 1st Qu.:1.000        1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :2.000        Median :2.0  \n Mean   :1.716        Mean   :2.2  \n 3rd Qu.:3.000        3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :3.000        Max.   :3.0  \n NA's   :82           NA's   :134  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nhints_select_coded_clean &lt;- drop_na(hints_select_coded)\n\ntable1 &lt;- hints_select_coded_clean %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary(\n    statistic = all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ± {sd}\",  \n  )\n\ntable1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 2,3151\n\n\n\n\nSeekCancerInfo\n\n\n\n\n    1\n2,315 (100%)\n\n\nCancerFrustrated\n\n\n\n\n    0\n759 (33%)\n\n\n    1\n780 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n624 (27%)\n\n\n    3\n152 (6.6%)\n\n\nCancerTrustDoctor\n\n\n\n\n    0\n11 (0.5%)\n\n\n    1\n72 (3.1%)\n\n\n    2\n441 (19%)\n\n\n    3\n1,791 (77%)\n\n\nCancerTrustFamily\n\n\n\n\n    1\n970 (42%)\n\n\n    2\n1,225 (53%)\n\n\n    3\n120 (5.2%)\n\n\nCancerTrustGov\n\n\n\n\n    0\n133 (5.7%)\n\n\n    1\n357 (15%)\n\n\n    2\n1,065 (46%)\n\n\n    3\n760 (33%)\n\n\nCancerTrustCharities\n\n\n\n\n    0\n251 (11%)\n\n\n    1\n798 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n1,086 (47%)\n\n\n    3\n180 (7.8%)\n\n\nCancerTrustReligiousOrgs\n\n\n\n\n    0\n907 (39%)\n\n\n    1\n832 (36%)\n\n\n    2\n494 (21%)\n\n\n    3\n82 (3.5%)\n\n\nCancerTrustScientists\n\n\n\n\n    0\n41 (1.8%)\n\n\n    1\n165 (7.1%)\n\n\n    2\n608 (26%)\n\n\n    3\n1,501 (65%)\n\n\nElectronic2_HealthInfo\n2,203 (95%)\n\n\nMisleadingHealthInfo\n\n\n\n\n    0\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    1\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    2\n959 (41%)\n\n\n    3\n782 (34%)\n\n\nTrustHCSystem\n\n\n\n\n    0\n60 (2.6%)\n\n\n    1\n231 (10.0%)\n\n\n    2\n1,109 (48%)\n\n\n    3\n915 (40%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot provides a visualization of the median, mode, and outliers in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot_data &lt;- hints_select_coded %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate)\n\n\nboxplot_data_long &lt;- boxplot_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\nggplot(boxplot_data_long, aes(x = Variable, y = Value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = \"red\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"HINTS Boxplot\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Values\"\n  ) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 4)) \n\n\nWarning: Removed 6739 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between different survey questions.\nUsing a correlation plot, the relationships are evaluated between the different survey questions.

    "text": "Project Authors: Tiana Le, Sheeba Moghal, Ishaan Babbar, Liz Kovalchuk\nIn the digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, understanding how people navigate and trust health information is critical. With countless sources such as healthcare professionals, government agencies, social media, and online forums, it is essential to explore what the United States population believes about the reliability and accessibility of health information. To better understand this phenomenon, data was gathered from an online forum called Reddit. The Reddit dataset comprises textual data that offers valuable insights into the information shared online about health, particularly topics related to cancer. Using NLP methods, we can explore the most common topics and also the sentiment toward these topics. In addition to the textual data, we will also use the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), which is administered by National Cancer Institute. In this survey, people were asked directly about what they think about health information. Using both the Reddit data and HINTS, we seek to understand trust, frustrations, and overall sentiment about healthcare and more specifically, cancer information.\nOur project explores the Pushshift Reddit Dataset to examine trust in healthcare, likely narrowing specifically to r/cancer forums.

below, the mean for trusting a doctor is higher than trusting the government. Given this information, we will also look at the Reddit dataset to see the level of trust users have when they mention the government in their comments versus doctors. In addition, the people who felt frustrated about the information they received about cancer is approximately 1.105. In the Reddit dataset, we also look for an equivalent using textual data by looking at positive/negative and emotion sentiment analysis on comments that include the word “cancer”.\n\nprint(summary(hints_select_coded))\n\n     HHID             updatedate        SeekCancerInfo   CancerFrustrated\n Length:6252        Min.   :1.387e+10   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.000   \n Class :character   1st Qu.:1.387e+10   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.000   \n Mode  :character   Median :1.387e+10   Median :0.0000   Median :1.000   \n                    Mean   :1.387e+10   Mean   :0.4654   Mean   :1.105   \n                    3rd Qu.:1.387e+10   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:2.000   \n                    Max.   :1.389e+10   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :3.000   \n                                        NA's   :17       NA's   :3420    \n CancerTrustDoctor CancerTrustFamily CancerTrustGov CancerTrustCharities\n Min.   :0.000     Min.   :1.000     Min.   :0.00   Min.   :0.000       \n 1st Qu.:2.000     1st Qu.:1.000     1st Qu.:1.00   1st Qu.:1.000       \n Median :3.000     Median :2.000     Median :2.00   Median :1.000       \n Mean   :2.656     Mean   :1.678     Mean   :1.92   Mean   :1.403       \n 3rd Qu.:3.000     3rd Qu.:2.000     3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:2.000       \n Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.000     Max.   :3.00   Max.   :3.000       \n NA's   :94        NA's   :783       NA's   :273    NA's   :308         \n CancerTrustReligiousOrgs CancerTrustScientists Electronic2_HealthInfo\n Min.   :0.0000           Min.   :0.000         Min.   :0.0000        \n 1st Qu.:0.0000           1st Qu.:2.000         1st Qu.:1.0000        \n Median :1.0000           Median :3.000         Median :1.0000        \n Mean   :0.9484           Mean   :2.357         Mean   :0.8534        \n 3rd Qu.:2.0000           3rd Qu.:3.000         3rd Qu.:1.0000        \n Max.   :3.0000           Max.   :3.000         Max.   :1.0000        \n NA's   :280              NA's   :218           NA's   :1130          \n MisleadingHealthInfo TrustHCSystem\n Min.   :0.000        Min.   :0.0  \n 1st Qu.:1.000        1st Qu.:2.0  \n Median :2.000        Median :2.0  \n Mean   :1.716        Mean   :2.2  \n 3rd Qu.:3.000        3rd Qu.:3.0  \n Max.   :3.000        Max.   :3.0  \n NA's   :82           NA's   :134  \n\n\n\nhints_select_coded_clean &lt;- drop_na(hints_select_coded)\n\ntable1 &lt;- hints_select_coded_clean %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate) %&gt;%\n  tbl_summary(\n    statistic = all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ± {sd}\",  \n  )\n\ntable1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 2,3151\n\n\n\n\nSeekCancerInfo\n\n\n\n\n    1\n2,315 (100%)\n\n\nCancerFrustrated\n\n\n\n\n    0\n759 (33%)\n\n\n    1\n780 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n624 (27%)\n\n\n    3\n152 (6.6%)\n\n\nCancerTrustDoctor\n\n\n\n\n    0\n11 (0.5%)\n\n\n    1\n72 (3.1%)\n\n\n    2\n441 (19%)\n\n\n    3\n1,791 (77%)\n\n\nCancerTrustFamily\n\n\n\n\n    1\n970 (42%)\n\n\n    2\n1,225 (53%)\n\n\n    3\n120 (5.2%)\n\n\nCancerTrustGov\n\n\n\n\n    0\n133 (5.7%)\n\n\n    1\n357 (15%)\n\n\n    2\n1,065 (46%)\n\n\n    3\n760 (33%)\n\n\nCancerTrustCharities\n\n\n\n\n    0\n251 (11%)\n\n\n    1\n798 (34%)\n\n\n    2\n1,086 (47%)\n\n\n    3\n180 (7.8%)\n\n\nCancerTrustReligiousOrgs\n\n\n\n\n    0\n907 (39%)\n\n\n    1\n832 (36%)\n\n\n    2\n494 (21%)\n\n\n    3\n82 (3.5%)\n\n\nCancerTrustScientists\n\n\n\n\n    0\n41 (1.8%)\n\n\n    1\n165 (7.1%)\n\n\n    2\n608 (26%)\n\n\n    3\n1,501 (65%)\n\n\nElectronic2_HealthInfo\n2,203 (95%)\n\n\nMisleadingHealthInfo\n\n\n\n\n    0\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    1\n287 (12%)\n\n\n    2\n959 (41%)\n\n\n    3\n782 (34%)\n\n\nTrustHCSystem\n\n\n\n\n    0\n60 (2.6%)\n\n\n    1\n231 (10.0%)\n\n\n    2\n1,109 (48%)\n\n\n    3\n915 (40%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot provides a visualization of the median, mode, and outliers in the dataset.\n\nboxplot_data &lt;- hints_select_coded %&gt;%\n  select(-HHID, -updatedate)\n\n\nboxplot_data_long &lt;- boxplot_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n\nggplot(boxplot_data_long, aes(x = Variable, y = Value)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = \"red\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"HINTS Boxplot\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Values\"\n  ) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 4)) \n\nWarning: Removed 6739 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between different survey questions.\nUsing a correlation plot, the relationships are evaluated between the different survey questions.

While there are some assumptions that need to be made to pair our corroborating dataset, the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) survey, with the Reddit dataset, we believe that we compare and use both of these datasets to investigate the following questions:\n\nIs public sentiment toward healthcare and cancer generally positive, or negative, in an online social platform?\nIs there evidence of trust (or lack thereof) when the public discusses healthcare?\nEvidence of other interpersonal conflict in healthcare discussions and emotion / sentiment analysis (e.g. sadness, disgust, surprise, joy, anger)."

It aims to assess how adults in the United States access and utilize health information with a particular focus on cancer-related topics. HINTS provides a rich source of data that helps researchers understand public interactions with health information, including trends in health communication, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding cancer prevention and control.\nIt is an excellent starting place for structured questionnaires that would be helfpul to enhance in a “more accessible” format of Reddit data.\nHINTS employs a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey methodology targeting non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older. This design allows for the collection of data that reflects the diverse experiences and perspectives of the U.S. population13. Annual Administration: Initially conducted biennially, HINTS has transitioned to an annual survey format. This change enhances the ability to track evolving trends in health information access and utilization over time.\nThe survey seeks information on:\n\nHealth information-seeking behaviors\nCancer prevention and screening practices\nKnowledge and perceptions related to cancer risks\nAccess to healthcare services\nUtilization of technology for health information37.\nPublicly Available Data: HINTS data is freely accessible through its website, allowing researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals to utilize this information for various applications, including the design and evaluation of health communication programs9.\n\nThough HINTS was initially conducted biennially, HINTS has transitioned to an annual survey format. This change enhances the ability to track evolving trends in health information access and utilization over time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\nlibrary(gt)\ngt(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n18.1\n6\n225.0\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n14.3\n8\n360.0\n245\n3.21\n3.570\n15.84\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n19.2\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.30\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n17.8\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.90\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n16.4\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n4.070\n17.40\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n17.3\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.730\n17.60\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n15.2\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.780\n18.00\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n10.4\n8\n472.0\n205\n2.93\n5.250\n17.98\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n10.4\n8\n460.0\n215\n3.00\n5.424\n17.82\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n14.7\n8\n440.0\n230\n3.23\n5.345\n17.42\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n15.5\n8\n318.0\n150\n2.76\n3.520\n16.87\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n15.2\n8\n304.0\n150\n3.15\n3.435\n17.30\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n13.3\n8\n350.0\n245\n3.73\n3.840\n15.41\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n19.2\n8\n400.0\n175\n3.08\n3.845\n17.05\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n27.3\n4\n79.0\n66\n4.08\n1.935\n18.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n26.0\n4\n120.3\n91\n4.43\n2.140\n16.70\n0\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n\n\n19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n\n\n21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2"

    "text": "Takeaways from Random Forest Models\nInitial Random Forest (RF) Model\nThe Initial Random Forest model achieves a high accuracy of 73.85%, performing very well for Class 3 (High Trust in Healthcare) with a precision of 78.33% and an excellent recall of 92.16%. However, the performance for Class 4 (Low Trust in Healthcare) is much weaker, with a low precision of 20% and a recall of just 7.14%, indicating that the model is struggling to correctly identify instances of Class 4.\nBalanced Random Forest (SMOTE) Model\nThe Balanced Random Forest model (with SMOTE) has a lower accuracy of 52.31%. While it improves the recall for Class 4 to 28.57%, the precision remains low at 16%. Class 3 performs well with a precision of 75% and a recall of 58.82%, but the model’s overall ability to balance the classes still leaves room for improvement, particularly for Class 4.\nTuned Random Forest Model\nThe Tuned Random Forest model shows improved performance with accuracy increasing to 61.54%. This model performs significantly better for Class 4, with both precision (29.63%) and recall (57.14%) improving. The precision for Class 3 is also very high (84.21%), with a solid recall of 62.75%. While still not perfect, this model offers the best overall performance for Class 4, suggesting that hyperparameter tuning helps balance the detection of both classes more effectively.\nConclusions:\n\nTuned RF is likely the best model based on this comparison, as it performs well across all metrics.\n\nTuned RF has the highest recall for Class 4 (0.85)\nTuned RF has the highest recall for Class 3 (0.70)\nTuned RF also has the highest precision for Class 4 (0.75)\nTuned RF has the highest precision for Class 3 (0.85)\nThe Tuned RF model has the highest accuracy (0.80)"

However, for Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low), the model struggles significantly with both precision and recall, both falling below 0.3. The Class Imbalance XGBoost model (SMOTE) improves recall for Class 1, helping to better detect the minority class. However, the model’s precision remains low, meaning it still incorrectly predicts many instances as Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low). The Hyperparameter Tuned XGBoost model delivers the best performance for Class 0 (Trust in Healthcare System - High), achieving very high recall (90%) and good precision (79%). Unfortunately, it still struggles with Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low), with very low recall and precision, despite the improvements from hyperparameter tuning.\nIn terms of overall performance, the Hyperparameter Tuned XGBoost model achieves the highest accuracy (74%), showing the best balance for Class 0 (Trust in Healthcare System - High), but it fails to capture Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low) effectively. The Class Imbalance XGBoost model (SMOTE) shows an improvement in Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low) recall but suffers from lower precision, while the Standard XGBoost model gives a decent balance for Class 0 (Trust in Healthcare System - High) but falls short for Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low).\nConclusions The Hyperparameter Tuned XGBoost model is the best overall in terms of accuracy and performance for Class 0 (Trust in Healthcare System - High), but further work is needed to improve recall and precision for Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low). Techniques such as class weighting or more advanced oversampling strategies might help address these issues. The Class Imbalance XGBoost model (SMOTE) provides some improvement for Class 1 (Trust in Healthcare System - Low) recall, but further fine-tuning of the class balancing methods could yield better results."
